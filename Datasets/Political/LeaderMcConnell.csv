1397273527137472513 2021-05-25 15:29:03 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The President’s rushed Afghanistan retreat is dangerous wishful thinking. Where will we base counterterrorism forces? How will we secure our Embassy? Support allies? What about women’s rights? Refugee flows?  Many crucial questions. No answers and no plan from the Administration.
1397242857040269312 2021-05-25 13:27:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> .@SenTomCotton and I have new legislation to fight anti-Semitism and ensure the bigoted thugs attacking Jewish Americans face the full force of our justice system. It’s sad our bill is urgently necessary today, in 2021, but I am proud to stand with the Jewish community.
1396937612833742854 2021-05-24 17:14:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The threats posed by China’s growing strategic capabilities and influence are real. But there's robust debate about how to meet them.   @POTUS has proposed to cut defense spending after inflation. But short-changing the U.S. military can’t be part of a serious China strategy.
1395839971165155331 2021-05-21 16:32:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Israel has been up against a terrorist organization that attacks innocent civilians. Hamas does not represent Palestinians. There is no moral equivalency here.  https://t.co/anwWNUnQ3b
1395756745738366980 2021-05-21 11:01:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> President Biden's plan to raise taxes would hit Americans at all income levels and slow the economy down to a crawl. It won't earn a single Republican vote. We're going to fight it the whole way.  https://t.co/olQi1YK1uS
1395543232482877441 2021-05-20 20:53:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> If there is truly broad, bipartisan support for taking our competition with China more seriously, there ought to be bipartisan support for robust defense funding to maintain our edge. All the ‘soft power’ in the world will only benefit us if we have the hard power to back it up.
1395487798954766342 2021-05-20 17:13:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Americans know what happens when the IRS is allowed to subject individuals to unequal scrutiny based on their politics. I was proud to work with @SenatorBraun on a bill that would stop bureaucrats from snooping on data they don’t need:  https://t.co/H2mUjl2Mqz
1395469941533552651 2021-05-20 16:02:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now to @FoxBusiness. I'm joining @larry_kudlow to discuss infrastructure, jobs, and the economy.
1395452423578259457 2021-05-20 14:52:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I applaud @POTUS for signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. Recent increases in anti-Asian hate crimes are alarming. I’m proud the Senate took bipartisan action — and, as the proud husband of a remarkable Asian-American woman, I am especially glad this effort is now law.
1395435972259717133 2021-05-20 13:47:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The crisis at our nation’s southern border is growing. CBP issued their April numbers and encounters with illegal entrants were 3% higher than in March.   The Biden Administration still won’t admit it, but the facts are clear.
1395071623787593731 2021-05-19 13:39:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Israel’s enemies are watching. Not just Hamas, but Hizballah, and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  We can not send the signal that terrorist attacks on American allies will be met with mealy-mouthed attempts to blame both sides.  https://t.co/1L54kFFTr1
1394733119253647362 2021-05-18 15:14:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> There is no moral equivalency between Israel, our ally, and Hamas, a terrorist organization funded by Iran.  https://t.co/v82OyMeUUz
1394441058277330944 2021-05-17 19:53:50 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The policies that we passed in March 2020 are not the policies we need in May 2021.   We are a reopening country flooded with vaccines. Record job openings. Democrats should not be taxing the Americans who are back at work to continue paying extra benefits to those staying home.
1394394681547575297 2021-05-17 16:49:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I'm a proud, steadfast supporter of Israel. The U.S. should stand closely with our friends.  President Biden must remain strong against the voices within his own party that want to create false equivalence between terrorists attacking Israel and the nation defending itself.
1393231789855027201 2021-05-14 11:48:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Iran is the most active state sponsor of terror in the world. The rockets raining down on Israel bear Iranian fingerprints. So do anti-American &amp; anti-Arab attacks. The Administration must not reward this behavior by reducing sanctions or jumping back into a failed nuclear deal.
1392944520250204169 2021-05-13 16:47:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> When Democrats forced through their partisan “COVID relief" bill, we said bad policies would slow rehiring and risk inflation. - April came in about 800,000 new jobs below expectations  - Unemployment actually inched back up  - The biggest reported inflation jump in over a decade  https://t.co/AQt8SQVbTH
1392909935248384003 2021-05-13 14:29:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats’ S. 1 is a partisan effort to take over our elections: Partisan control of the FEC. Partisan rules for states. Public funds sent to partisan campaigns.    There is nothing bipartisan about it. S. 1 would shatter confidence in our democracy.  https://t.co/YRfMBCXPXo
1392890155036446725 2021-05-13 13:11:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> As we observe National Police Week, I had the honor of welcoming members of Kentucky’s Fraternal Order of Police to the Capitol. Standing with law enforcement isn’t something we do one week a year. We need to back the blue all year round.  https://t.co/DTYvPaIR0U
1392618555317882886 2021-05-12 19:11:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Appreciated meeting today with Foreign Minister @MarisePayne of Australia. We discussed our nations’ efforts to meet shared challenges, from China’s aggression to democracy in Burma and counterterrorism in Afghanistan. It was a good conversation with a great ally.  https://t.co/Ien9Lv3sKD
1392602945963888643 2021-05-12 18:09:50 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now: I'm joining @BretBaier on @FoxNews to discuss the prospects for a real, bipartisan infrastructure bill and why Democrats' plan for a partisan takeover of our democracy failed in committee yesterday.
1392542762935914497 2021-05-12 14:10:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I had a productive meeting at the White House with President Biden and congressional leaders. There is a bipartisan desire to get an outcome on infrastructure. It will take a bipartisan process to get one.  https://t.co/TAyE4D6uzM
1392500113801633803 2021-05-12 11:21:13 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Israel must know that their friends and allies in the United States stand with them.  We support Israel’s right to peace and security. We support their goal of restoring deterrence. The Administration must not relax our efforts to hold terrorists and their supporters to account.
1392230034837057538 2021-05-11 17:28:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats’ election takeover bill would literally hand public money to political campaigns. I proposed an amendment to instead send that money to fight the opioid epidemic and fentanyl that kill Americans. Democrats blocked it and voted to send the cash to politicians instead.  https://t.co/2oQsHVPaU0
1392135602989043713 2021-05-11 11:12:47 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats want to rewrite the rules of our elections and restrict Americans’ free speech on a purely partisan basis.  Hard to imagine anything that would shatter public confidence in our democracy more dramatically than a transparent partisan power grab.  https://t.co/bjrCh4tFeW
1391919056463278082 2021-05-10 20:52:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Vaccines are available nationwide. We have millions of unfilled job openings. It is not fair to keep taxing working Americans to continue paying an extra federal bonus to folks who continue to stay home. And it’s holding back our nation’s recovery.
1391876429063892998 2021-05-10 18:02:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats’ partisan power-grab “election reform” bill is not about voting rights. It’s about letting Washington Democrats control the terms of political debate and all 50 states’ election laws.  Republicans will expose this attempted D.C. takeover in tomorrow’s hearing.  https://t.co/Qv2FoAQEJK
1388538711994994694 2021-05-01 13:00:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> .@RepAndyBarr and I introduced bipartisan legislation after last year’s @KentuckyDerby to preserve our Commonwealth's signature racing industry.  Now, Thoroughbred racing is well-positioned for the future.  https://t.co/62WHO9DymH
1388463213566586880 2021-05-01 08:00:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> As Kentuckians, Thoroughbred racing is practically in our bones. It’s who we are. We find our state’s unique history on the track and in the stables. Today, the best of the Bluegrass is on full display at the 147th running of the @KentuckyDerby.  https://t.co/7MQSvmGkG7
1388235252070559754 2021-04-30 16:54:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> A number of Senate Republicans wrote President Biden’s @USEdGov today opposing a new proposal to skew civics and U.S. history toward activist indoctrination that is designed to push Americans apart. Our kids deserve the best.   Read our letter:  https://t.co/1Mxr0LFVkp
1388163257693782022 2021-04-30 12:08:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> President Biden hasn’t tried to do anything remotely moderate. He ran as a moderate, but everything he's recommended is far left.    Think of it as the Biden bait-and-switch. Bernie Sanders is really happy.  https://t.co/uEsDSF7Q6z
1388118731650445313 2021-04-30 09:11:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This Administration wants to raise taxes to nudge families toward the kinds of jobs Democrats want Americans to have, in the industries they want to exist, using the kinds of childcare they endorse. These plans aren’t about creating options; they’re imposing a vision.
1387932341390258180 2021-04-29 20:50:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> .@SenatorTimScott is a brave, courageous, and inspirational leader. If you want to see the future, watch his great speech from last night. He laid out what the Republican Party today and tomorrow is going to look like.  https://t.co/VYjr8uyv4C
1387844275828834308 2021-04-29 15:00:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in to @FoxNews. I am joining @marthamaccallum to discuss the contrast between President Biden’s Joint Address and Senator Tim Scott’s Republican response.
1387817442366394369 2021-04-29 13:13:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Last night, President Biden talked about unity and togetherness. But he delivered a multi-trillion-dollar shopping list that was not even intended to earn bipartisan buy-in. A lengthy liberal daydream that would force American families’ lives into Washington Democrats’ mold.
1387598502700765188 2021-04-28 22:43:58 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am so glad the nation heard @SenatorTimScott's outstanding Republican response to President Biden’s address. Republicans stand for the principles and policies that unite Americans and expand opportunity for working families. Not radical agendas designed to push us apart.
1386853442707144706 2021-04-26 21:23:21 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans have responded to Democrats’ “infrastructure” bill with a smart proposal to meet real needs.   Roads. Bridges. Ports. Airports. Waterways. Broadband.   Are Democrats ready to work together? Or was “infrastructure” just wrapping paper for more gifts to the far left?
1386802064580386818 2021-04-26 17:59:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> As a polio victim myself, I fully understand the significance of vaccines. After decades of research, polio vaccine trials began on this day in 1954.   Now, we developed multiple COVID vaccines in under a year. We all need to receive this modern medical miracle.  https://t.co/9l0nz70CMd
1385317747350020105 2021-04-22 15:41:03 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> .@SenatorTimScott is not just one of the strongest leaders in the Senate. He is one of the most inspiring and unifying leaders in our nation. I'm glad he’ll be delivering the Republican Address following the President’s remarks on Wednesday.
1385291316008034313 2021-04-22 13:56:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This Administration’s zeal for costly climate policy at home is not matched by our biggest competitors. China’s share of emissions is nearly double ours. The Paris Agreement is largely toothless.  Democrats can kill U.S. jobs &amp; industries with no real impact on global emissions.
1385273965199953921 2021-04-22 12:47:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today, Senate Republicans introduced our framework to improve our nation's infrastructure.   Americans need and deserve bipartisan infrastructure solutions. I hope Democrats will come to the table and work with us on a bipartisan path forward to strengthen our homeland.
1384915373129076738 2021-04-21 13:02:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The late Justice Ginsburg rejected the discredit concept of court-packing.  “If anything would make the Court appear partisan, it would be that.”  “Nine seems to be a good number.”  Justice Breyer just reaffirmed his own opposition. And the American people agree overwhelmingly.
1384886323694260228 2021-04-21 11:06:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> A major theme of the Biden Administration has been false advertising:   Last month, it was the multi-trillion-dollar “COVID relief” bill that spent only 1% on vaccines.   Now it’s a multi-trillion-dollar “infrastructure” plan where roads and bridges are almost a rounding error.
1384601958124711938 2021-04-20 16:16:46 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The situation at our southern border: record arrivals of unaccompanied minors.   The White House’s response: police the terminology border officials are allowed to use to describe the crisis.   Not securing the border. Just woke proofreading, in a parody of left-wing governance.
1384555191274557441 2021-04-20 13:10:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Foreign fentanyl analogues from China and elsewhere are incredibly poisonous drugs that kill Americans.   They're currently classified as illegal controlled substances. But some Democrats want to let that status expire.   Absurd. We should make this permanent. It's a no-brainer.
1384311734073180162 2021-04-19 21:03:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> China jails peaceful dissidents, saying “only patriots” should govern Hong Kong.   The real patriots are the peaceful activists they have jailed and the hundreds of thousands still carrying the torch for democracy.   The free world must have their backs.
1384253822697021440 2021-04-19 17:13:24 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Last year, @SenatorTimScott and Republicans tried to pass major legislation that would have expanded body cameras, discouraged chokeholds, increased transparency, and finally made lynching a federal crime.  Democrats filibustered the bill because it wasn’t anti-police enough.
1383455196584431622 2021-04-17 12:19:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We are returning a generation of heroes to the forefront of our national memory — and the center of our nation’s capital.   Thanks to the @WW1CC and all who have made the new National World War I Memorial possible.  https://t.co/HnUgwmzULB
1382805615920218112 2021-04-15 17:18:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Proud to introduce the CAROL Act today, alongside @SenatorSinema, one of @RepAndyBarr’s friends. This important legislation is a fitting tribute to a wonderful Kentuckian. It embodies Carol’s lifetime of service to others. I look forward to its passage.
1382735333159284737 2021-04-15 12:39:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats keep showing they don’t care about norms and institutions, only power. The latest example: a bill to pack the Supreme Court and destroy its legitimacy to guarantee the rulings liberals want.
1382395431125127171 2021-04-14 14:08:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> H.R.1 isn’t about justice, equality, or responding to recent state laws. It’s a recycled recipe for a massive Democrat takeover that they’ve been pushing under changing justifications for multiple years. Read the bill.
1382380312647368705 2021-04-14 13:08:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Washington Post has given the WH its worst rating, Four Pinocchios, for repeated lies about election law.    Democrats want to create a national controversy over voting regulations. But facts keep getting in their way.
1382097070992031744 2021-04-13 18:23:14 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> There is a bipartisan appetite for smart infrastructure bills. In fact, all the multi-year highway bills have been bipartisan going back decades.  There isn’t an appetite for using the word “infrastructure” to justify a multi-trillion-dollar slush fund for unrelated bad ideas.
1382047303498928128 2021-04-13 15:05:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Foreign terrorists will not leave the U.S. alone simply because our politicians have grown tired of taking the fight to them. The President needs to explain to the American people how abandoning our partners and retreating in the face of the Taliban will make America safer.
1381991061229289473 2021-04-13 11:21:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Officer Billy Evans died defending this Capitol, its institutions, and the thousands of people who work here. Today the Senate and the entire country are holding Officer Evans and his family in our thoughts and prayers. His sacrifice will not be forgotten.
1380632649660829696 2021-04-09 17:24:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This new court-packing commission is not some serious pivot away from Democrats’ political attacks on the Court. It’s just an attempt to clothe those attacks in fake legitimacy.  My full statement:  https://t.co/qX639r68M3
1380584569607442438 2021-04-09 14:13:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Talk is cheap, but defending our country is not. We can't afford to fail in our constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense. Both parties should be able to agree that we must maintain America’s edge over China.  Our joint statement:  https://t.co/7BHXvBBIvB
1380221119798652929 2021-04-08 14:08:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats’ “infrastructure” proposal goes way beyond what working Americans would call infrastructure. It tries to use a bipartisan issue as a Trojan horse for tax hikes and miscellaneous liberal policies.   We need to tackle infrastructure in a more targeted way.  https://t.co/GWlADEG2SD
1379057301827555330 2021-04-05 09:04:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our private sector must stop taking cues from the Outrage-Industrial Complex. Americans do not need or want big business to amplify disinformation or react to every manufactured controversy with frantic left-wing signaling. My full statement:  https://t.co/3Ck3qW4Mbe
1378649159532691460 2021-04-04 06:02:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> May you and your family have a blessed and joyful Easter Sunday.
1378088355448168453 2021-04-02 16:54:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am heartbroken that Officer Evans was killed today in the line of duty. On this Good Friday, let's all pray for healing for the surviving officer, comfort for Officer Evans’s family, and for all the officers and families of the United States Capitol Police.   My full statement:  https://t.co/0ykpCLaoJX
1378044627819888640 2021-04-02 14:00:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Praying for the United States Capitol Police officers who were attacked at the Capitol. We are still learning what’s taken place. Grateful to all the USCP and first responders who are on the scene.
1377753642279780357 2021-04-01 18:44:00 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The latest news from Hong Kong only confirms Beijing’s tightening totalitarian grip over the formerly autonomous region. It is essential the Biden Administration work with like-minded partners to impose meaningful international consequences. My full statement:  https://t.co/Liz39tDXS8
1377384890799362052 2021-03-31 18:18:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> My advice to the Administration: If you want to do an infrastructure bill, let's do an infrastructure bill.  Before the pandemic, we had the best economy in 50 years. We should not raise taxes under the guise of an infrastructure bill and send our economy in the wrong direction.  https://t.co/QFcHmP7GQI
1377374325058142209 2021-03-31 17:36:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Administration’s non-infrastructure “infrastructure bill” looks like another Trojan horse for far-left demands. Rolling back Right to Work laws. Imposing the biggest new tax hikes in a generation — killing jobs and slowing wage growth when workers need a fast recovery.
1377370588637921280 2021-03-31 17:21:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> There would be bipartisan support for a serious, targeted infrastructure plan. Unfortunately, less than 6% of this massive White House proposal would go to roads and bridges. It would spend more on electric cars than on roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways combined.  https://t.co/WjIvBSwpsg
1376948377204690947 2021-03-30 13:24:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It’s a modern medical miracle that three safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines were produced in less than one year. Thanks to hardworking Kentuckians at the McKesson facility in Shepherdsville, those vaccines are being distributed all across the country.  https://t.co/JZIxcWxJBu
1375157655937880069 2021-03-25 14:48:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The border crisis is not just seasonal. CBP is tracking the largest surge in apprehensions in 20 years. Unaccompanied children are piling up in close quarters.   It turns out when politicians spend a two-year campaign advertising a porous border and amnesty, people listen.
1374773663648595976 2021-03-24 13:22:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats’ attempted elections takeover has state and local officials sounding alarms. They say its unworkable provisions would invite total chaos in our elections. Even Democratic officials.  No wonder Democrats want to talk about everything except what's actually in their bill.  https://t.co/8IL3M1Z1Ie
1374737219165040644 2021-03-24 10:57:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats' H.R. 1 would leave elections more vulnerable to cheating, send taxpayer dollars to subsidize campaigns, and would turn the bipartisan Federal Election Commission into a Democrat-controlled partisan body.  It’s not about protecting voting. It’s about rigging the system.  https://t.co/POrUh2bq9H
1374718738210160653 2021-03-24 09:44:22 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now to @FoxNews: I am joining @DanaPerino and @BillHemmer to discuss the crisis at our southern border and the Democrats' plan for a partisan takeover of America’s election systems.
1374429186224353289 2021-03-23 14:33:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> H.R. 1 is the Democrats’ plan to take over the American election system and have it run by Washington bureaucrats. Democrats want to force all kinds of unpopular changes on all 50 states because they believe it would benefit their side.  https://t.co/ZZZcZ77PHM
1374397439164043275 2021-03-23 12:27:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Democrats just spent the last four years using the legislative filibuster and talking constantly about how important it was.  Their reversals aren’t about principle. It’s just raw power. And their excuses insult the intelligence of the American people.
1374030566920708099 2021-03-22 12:09:50 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> A key purpose of the Senate was to ensure all parts of the country have a voice.   Leaders from New York and California want to break the Senate’s rules on legislation because they want to steamroll the interests of Kentucky and Middle America.    https://t.co/Tek5MhZCVx
1373718365773127688 2021-03-21 15:29:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Secretary Mayorkas testified “the border is secure and the border is not open.”  So either @fema has been deployed just to admire a situation going smoothly... or the Biden Administration is not being straight with the American people.
1372997733859086343 2021-03-19 15:45:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The science on getting kids back in school is crystal clear. Every day the Biden Administration does not urge schools to reopen safely right now with simple precautions, the most vulnerable kids pay the price.
1372582583893102599 2021-03-18 12:16:04 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Administration claims their top priority is to beat this virus and end the pandemic. But their nominee to run @HHSGov is woefully unqualified. California AG Xavier Becerra is a partisan politician with no expertise in healthcare.
1372528622326648833 2021-03-18 08:41:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> If Democrats break the Senate rules and kill the filibuster by a 50-50 vote, they will regret it. The pendulum would swing both ways, and it would swing hard.  https://t.co/x2EM4EgTIc
1372299448223686662 2021-03-17 17:30:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> My definition of a crisis is when you send the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which only goes to emergencies, down to the border.   This is a crisis. The Administration created it, and they own it.  https://t.co/mDxERtkDjK
1372263858014978051 2021-03-17 15:09:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Eliminating the legislative filibuster is not in the best interest of the country, no matter which party is in control.  Anyone who really understands the Senate knows that steamrolling the rules wouldn't fast-track policymaking. Everything would grind to a halt.
1372261126193479693 2021-03-17 14:58:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Top Democrats’ drive to break Senate rules is shamelessly hypocritical. Just two years ago, they called the filibuster an essential part of the Senate that should never go away.   Apparently their only principle is that they want Democrats to have all the power, all the time.  https://t.co/FPzKemNSWU
1372209978791051265 2021-03-17 11:35:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now to @FoxNews. I am joining @HARRISFAULKNER to discuss Democrats’ border crisis and the importance of preserving Senate rules on legislation.
1371853740819558408 2021-03-16 11:59:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Breaking Senate rules to kill the filibuster would not open up an express lane to liberal change. It would not open up an express lane for the Biden presidency to speed into the history books. The Senate would function more like a hundred-car pile-up. Nothing moving.
1371571113432649728 2021-03-15 17:16:50 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I'm glad @SecBlinken and @SecDef are engaging with key Asian allies Japan and South Korea this week. We need to work together to defend against threats from China and North Korea and stand up for democracy in Burma in the face of military dictatorship.
1371565315553951750 2021-03-15 16:53:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Why did President Biden tell Americans to wait until July 4th to gather in ways that cities, states, and the CDC approve right now?  Why did he present a million vaccines per day as a personal “Mission Accomplished” moment when it’s simply the pace Democrats inherited in January?
1371565276941197315 2021-03-15 16:53:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> On Thursday, President Biden spoke in a heartfelt way about grief and loss. But his vision for the road ahead missed the mark. His proclamations broke with Dr. Fauci and his own CDC and ignored what Americans are already doing now. It was like a speech for an alternate universe.
1370472642659106818 2021-03-12 15:31:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats' H.R. 1 is a partisan assault on elections. It directly targets political speech and would centralize control of elections in all 50 states in Washington Democrats’ hands.   A dramatic one-party power grab over the way Americans vote.  https://t.co/ObjBkEnobS
1370190279437860870 2021-03-11 20:49:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In 2020, Senate Republicans led Congress to pass five historic bipartisan bills.   Because of that, the American people have been marching toward victory. Democrats just want to sprint to the front of that parade and claim the credit.
1370188479087452164 2021-03-11 20:42:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our country has endured one of the most painful years in memory. But the dark times have spotlighted the best of America.    This year’s recovery will ride an already turning tide. Not because of a Democrats’ latest partisan bill, but because of the resilience of our people.  https://t.co/2JC1V8ic30
1369783805519740934 2021-03-10 17:54:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Last Congress, Sen. Schumer and Democrats used the filibuster frequently. And I respected the institution more than any short-term advantage we might have achieved if we’d eliminated it.    Majorities come and go, but the essence of the Senate stays.  https://t.co/AbUmsKf6R5
1369752247358341120 2021-03-10 15:49:19 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> President Biden's spending bill is a classic example of big Democratic overreach in the name of COVID relief. It manages to spend only ~1% on vaccinations and less than 9% on the entire health fight.   This is by far one of the worst pieces of legislation I've seen in the Senate.  https://t.co/lhU3wPm2kI
1369719148973068294 2021-03-10 13:37:47 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Administration is flailing and failing on our southern border. The number of unaccompanied children has tripled in two weeks.   The White House keeps saying “Now is not the time to come.” So there will be a good time in the future to break federal law and come illegally?
1369683136460767249 2021-03-10 11:14:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’ve voted for several of President Biden’s nominees. But his choices to lead Interior and the EPA appear eager to restart the left’s war on domestic energy. Kentuckians know that when radical policies are on the table, it means their jobs and pocketbooks are on the menu.
1369417369500725248 2021-03-09 17:38:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats’ attempt to forcibly rewrite 50 states’ election laws would weaken voter I.D., mass legalize ballot harvesting, and let a partisan FEC poke around in more of citizens' political speech.  No wonder the only thing bipartisan about the bill was the vote against it.
1368995803763798016 2021-03-08 13:43:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senator Blunt has tackled so much important work for Missouri and our country and has been an enormous asset to all his colleagues. I’m very sorry he’ll be stepping away but am glad the country has two more years to keep benefitting from his talent. My full statement:  https://t.co/Q3HN53yaT5
1368270773924880391 2021-03-06 13:42:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Instead of working together to fight COVID-19, Democrats decided to exploit the crisis by jamming through unrelated liberal policies they couldn’t pass honestly. A colossal missed opportunity for the American people. My full statement:  https://t.co/p321zYjGjU
1368057796940431364 2021-03-05 23:36:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats said they’d exploit COVID to “restructure things to fit our vision.”  Sure enough: Only 9% of their bill for the entire health fight. Only 1% for vaccines. All this borrowed money for a parade of unrelated policies that even left-wing experts say are badly targeted.
1367846452001714182 2021-03-05 09:36:22 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We're already set to come roaring back — not due to this liberal spending spree. Democrats inherited a tide that was already turning.  We could have worked together to do something smart &amp; bipartisan to finish this fight ASAP.  Democrats decided to do something else.
1367524069437018115 2021-03-04 12:15:20 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am continuing to monitor severe flooding across Kentucky. Yesterday I spoke with leaders in some of the hardest-hit counties. My staff and I are ready to do our part to get federal assistance to these communities.  https://t.co/51otsqeSzp
1367203407522635776 2021-03-03 15:01:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN NOW: I'm joining @marthamaccallum to discuss the urgent priorities Senate Republicans are focused on -- reopening schools, helping workers, and getting more Americans vaccinated -- and the liberal wish-list Democrats are pushing instead.
1367178787763462144 2021-03-03 13:23:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> What the American people need are fast-acting plans to open schools now, get laid-off Americans into jobs, and finish the fight against COVID-19.   The Democrats’ plan doesn’t focus on that. It manages to spend ~$2T while leaving the most urgent things on the cutting room floor.  https://t.co/6UyBLBZPsH
1366887843621134340 2021-03-02 18:07:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It was my honor to get to thank some of the @kentuckyguard who answered the call to help protect the Capitol. Your Congress and your country appreciate all you’ve done.  https://t.co/I09FN45AjW
1366788842750115845 2021-03-02 11:33:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Less than 9% of Democrats' spending plan would go to directly fight COVID-19. Less than 1% to vaccinations.   This isn’t a recipe to safely reopen America. It’s what Democrats promised almost a year ago: Taking advantage of the crisis to check off unrelated liberal policies.
1366511322188439553 2021-03-01 17:11:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Only 1% of the Democrats’ partisan bill goes to vaccines. Less than 9% to the entire health effort. It backs the Big Labor myth that schools can’t reopen safely right now — yet only a small fraction of its K-12 money would go out this year.  Liberal ideology, not families' needs.
1366397909516881924 2021-03-01 09:40:22 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> More great news this morning as Kentuckians help turn the tide against COVID-19. The newly-approved Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is now shipping out, thanks to workers at McKesson’s distribution facility in Shepherdsville.
1365690894003957761 2021-02-27 10:50:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The House’s partisan vote reflects a deliberately partisan process and a missed opportunity to meet Americans’ needs. My full statement:  https://t.co/AhM58wcIGK
1365431909883478018 2021-02-26 17:41:50 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Washington should focus on practical policies to finish this fight. Accelerate vaccinations. Get kids back in school. Help laid-off Americans get rehired.  Instead, Democrats are pushing a partisan bill, packed with non-COVID-related spending &amp; bad ideas that will slow recovery.  https://t.co/2SCBy1NlnX
1365074656429039620 2021-02-25 18:02:14 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN NOW: I am joining @BretBaier to discuss Republicans’ work to help our nation reopen and recover — and the $1.9T liberal spending plan the Democrats are focused on instead.  https://t.co/VK9XdAnsh6
1364643272770154497 2021-02-24 13:28:04 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Only about 1% of the Democrats’ partisan plan goes to vaccines. Only about 5% of its K-12 funding would even go out this fiscal year.   Democrats are not addressing the urgent needs of a re-opening America. They started with a preconceived liberal wish-list and worked backwards.
1364373883529404420 2021-02-23 19:37:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This evening I joined congressional leaders on the Capitol steps in a moment of silence for the 500,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus.  https://t.co/FtsMr8Qurz
1364336298643841025 2021-02-23 17:08:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Science and data disprove the Democrats' notion that K-12 schools need their new spending plan before they can open safely.  Under their plan, about 95% of the K-12 money would not even go toward the current year’s budget.  Stop letting Big Labor move the goalposts on our kids.
1364274777800781832 2021-02-23 13:03:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The facts are clear: In-person schooling is essential for kids and can be safe. France and Spain have been doing it. The U.K. will have kids back in two weeks. A study from our own CDC last month found that schools can operate safely.  Why won't Democrats accept the science?
1363990094739341315 2021-02-22 18:12:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The partisan bill Democrats are preparing is stuffed with non-COVID-related liberal goals and more band-aid policies as if the country were going to stay shut down another year.  We need 2021 to be different than 2020. Congress should focus on smart policies to help that happen.
1363963049808453632 2021-02-22 16:25:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Families across Kentucky are still recovering from a week of punishing weather. I am grateful to everyone who pitched in and helped their neighbors stay safe. My team and I are focused and ready to help in the recovery.
1362113761113493506 2021-02-17 13:56:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Rush Limbaugh was a generational media trailblazer. He gave a voice to millions of conservative Americans whom the mainstream media had not even tried to represent. His impact is impossible to overstate. May he rest in peace.
1359174130545930243 2021-02-09 11:15:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> For the three and a half decades that my friend Richard Shelby has served in the Senate, the people of Alabama have had a true heavyweight champion in their corner. I’m glad our friend still has two more years to continue his important and effective work here in the Capitol.
1358903701000323073 2021-02-08 17:21:04 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats' so-called relief bill includes Sen. Sanders’s minimum wage proposal that would kill 1.4M American jobs. This after the President killed many thousands of jobs with Keystone XL.  Killing jobs and destroying opportunity — that's their idea of pandemic relief?
1358903669329186816 2021-02-08 17:20:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats admitted last March: They see the pandemic as an opportunity to ram through ideological change.   That's why they are now pushing a sprawling $1.9T plan that even liberal economists say is poorly targeted to the urgent needs of our nation.
1358533374575587338 2021-02-07 16:49:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> George Shultz was one of the great Americans of our time. Nobody better exemplified a thoughtful, principled, and patriotic commitment to public service. A scholar-statesman for the ages. My full statement:  https://t.co/lC8r9mNmm1
1357364946800148483 2021-02-04 11:26:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Pres. Biden's own scientists agree school appears to be quite safe and we should get our kids back.  Congress sent massive sums for K-12 schools in 2020. Hardly any of it has been spent yet.  Federal funding is not the issue. It's Big Labor moving the goalposts on kids &amp; parents.
1357089516071313409 2021-02-03 17:12:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We’ve heard a lot of talk about unity, but White House staff and congressional Democrats are working from the opposite playbook. Senate Republicans will be ready and waiting with a host of amendments to improve the rushed procedural step that’s being jammed through.  https://t.co/HjAPLAg2Ae
1357039726549741569 2021-02-03 13:54:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Science tells us that in-person school can be safe — and is crucial for children’s futures. We cannot keep this essential part of our society on indefinite hiatus.  No more goalpost-moving from Big Labor. Kids have sacrificed enough. States and districts need to get this done.
1357039725652099077 2021-02-03 13:54:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Science has spoken and the evidence is clear: It is time to get kids back in school.   Experts say that with basic precautions, risks of transmission are low. And the costs of the online-only approach for kids are very high.
1357019355142381568 2021-02-03 12:33:21 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This morning, Congress honored Officer Brian D. Sicknick under the dome of the institution he swore to defend — and died defending.    In the face of lawlessness, Officer Sicknick paid the ultimate price. His name will never be forgotten.  https://t.co/sn7siRkQMh
1356751045859418112 2021-02-02 18:47:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> First Navalny was poisoned. Now he’s been jailed. Peaceful protesters across Russia are being suppressed. Just the latest in Putin’s long campaign to subvert democracy and the rule of law. The U.S. and our allies must continue strong measures to hold Putin and cronies to account.
1356666396894191618 2021-02-02 13:10:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’ve had good conversations with @POTUS and @SecBlinken about the need for a swift and decisive response from the U.S. and allies following the coup in Burma. Expect the Administration will quickly sanction the junta and defend democracy.
1356653659308912640 2021-02-02 12:20:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’ve voted for several of President Biden’s mainstream cabinet nominees. But his choice to run Homeland Security was blasted by the Obama Administration’s own Inspector General for running an immigration law favor factory for powerful Democrats. Bad pick with major ethics issues.
1356258145560092675 2021-02-01 10:08:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I call on Burma’s military to immediately release the civilian political leaders of the country and turn back from this abyss. We need to support the people of Burma in their journey toward democracy and impose costs on those who stand in their way. My full statement:  https://t.co/C2uOjnIVQx
1355266388798173189 2021-01-29 16:27:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The last four years showed U.S. prosperity, domestic energy security, and reducing emissions do not have to conflict.   This Piecemeal Green New Deal through liberal executive orders gets it dead wrong.   There's nothing "green" about a tsunami of pink slips for American workers.
1354204878114086916 2021-01-26 18:09:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today, I made clear that if Democrats ever attack the key Senate rules, it would drain the consent and comity out of the institution. A scorched-earth Senate would hardly be able to function. It wouldn’t be a progressive’s dream. It would be a nightmare.  I guarantee it.
1354187035272241153 2021-01-26 16:58:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate requires collaboration and deliberation. It’s a feature, not a bug, that slim majorities can't ram through half-baked ideas.  My remarks on the legislative filibuster and why I stuck up for the minority’s rights even when Republicans had power:  https://t.co/vtKFPDeVJe
1353888999522398214 2021-01-25 21:14:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’m glad that two Senate Democrats confirmed today they will not vote to end the legislative filibuster. They agree with President Biden and me on protecting the Senate.   With this win, we can move forward with a 50-50 power-sharing agreement built on the 2001 precedent.  https://t.co/fHUCFxxXh8
1352751229848457217 2021-01-22 17:53:20 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It was my honor to get to meet and thank some of the @KentuckyGuard who answered the call to help protect the Capitol and the inauguration.  https://t.co/yWguG607kR
1352355298661560324 2021-01-21 15:40:03 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The failed Paris deal will hurt American families while China and Russia grow emissions.  The Keystone cancellation will kill union jobs and hurt U.S. energy security.  And a proposal to gut immigration enforcement and give blanket amnesty?  Rough "day one" for American workers.
1352317412226568198 2021-01-21 13:09:30 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Minority rights on legislation are key to the Senate. President Biden spent decades defending them. More than two dozen Senate Democrats backed them just four years ago.  This isn't complicated. Simply reaffirming that Democrats won't break the rules should not be a heavy lift.
1352034550646517765 2021-01-20 18:25:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today, before the entire world, the greatest nation in history carried out another peaceful transfer of power.  Congratulations to President Biden and Vice President Harris. I look forward to working together everywhere we can and differing respectfully when we must.
1351617411271827461 2021-01-19 14:47:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tomorrow a new POTUS and VPOTUS will be sworn in. It will be secure because many other brave Americans have sworn their own oaths to support and defend our Constitution.   Thanks to the Capitol Police and all the federal &amp; local personnel helping protect our democracy this week.
1351151585846562823 2021-01-18 07:56:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today we honor one of our nation’s great heroes. Dr. King called on America to truly fulfill our founding principles and provide justice and opportunity for all. His work and his example have brought us a long way and they inspire us to keep working.  https://t.co/nOKGJS1Jlb

1349010352307101697 2021-01-12 10:08:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our nation lost a remarkable American with the passing of Sheldon Adelson. Elaine and I send our condolences to Miriam, the entire Adelson family, and all who mourn today. May his memory be a great blessing.  https://t.co/SHnRZlbLgF
1347904876416823297 2021-01-09 08:55:40 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate grieves the death of the officer who literally put himself on the line to defend our first branch of gov’t and everybody who works inside it. Our condolences and our prayers are with Officer Sicknick’s family and his colleagues at this terrible time. My full statement:  https://t.co/FHm3T9Psvk
1347253739615354881 2021-01-07 13:48:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The ultimate blame for yesterday’s events lies with the unhinged criminals who tried to disrupt our government and with those who incited them. But this fact does not preclude our addressing the shocking failures in the Capitol’s security posture and protocols. My full statement:  https://t.co/2oJljGDiU8
1346993833939238914 2021-01-06 20:35:30 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The United States and the Senate will not be intimidated.   We are back at our posts. We will discharge our duty under the Constitution for our nation.  And we are going to do it tonight.  https://t.co/YH0PtXKDzt
1346897398984024065 2021-01-06 14:12:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I will vote to respect the American people’s decision and defend our system of government. My full remarks:  https://t.co/RSTjyjZmJq
1343365527851429888 2020-12-27 20:17:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I applaud the President’s decision to get billions of dollars of crucial COVID-19 relief out the door and into the hands of American families. I am glad the American people will receive this much-needed assistance as our nation continues battling this pandemic. My full statement:  https://t.co/YSPYsPu2ct
1342455058382786564 2020-12-25 08:00:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Even in a dark winter, Christmas brings light. I am grateful for our healthcare heroes, the servicemembers who keep us safe, the modern miracle of safe and effective vaccines, and the blessing of our Savior's birth.   I wish your family a healthy and Merry Christmas.  https://t.co/CMMZlkbdYw
1341242737232932865 2020-12-21 23:42:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> BREAKING: The Senate just passed another major bipartisan, COVID-19 relief package. The American people can rest assured that more help is on the way, immediately.
1341149447972118528 2020-12-21 17:32:00 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans have been trying since July to get more targeted, bipartisan relief into the hands of the American people. Until the election, Democrats kept saying no.  I’m glad for our country that we are finally moving ahead together.  https://t.co/G8PUrQgGN8
1341096731270909952 2020-12-21 14:02:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now: I’m joining @DanaPerino on @FoxNews to discuss the bipartisan, bicameral agreement for another major COVID-19 rescue package for the American people.
1340790116927877128 2020-12-20 17:44:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> BREAKING: As the American people continue battling the coronavirus this holiday season, they will not be on their own.   Congress has just reached an agreement. We will pass another rescue package ASAP. More help is on the way.
1340724518466301958 2020-12-20 13:23:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I think both sides agree: Our around-the-clock negotiations on COVID relief are hours away from completion. Our citizens need this waiting to end. Thousands of Americans are being robbed of their lives every day. Working families are hurting. Let’s finally get this done today.
1340336807205085185 2020-12-19 11:42:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I appreciate the good-faith spirit that has characterized the bipartisan negotiations this past week. But the American people cannot feed their families or pay their bills with Congress’s good-faith discussions. They need us to act. We need to conclude talks and land this plane.
1340005642006892546 2020-12-18 13:46:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Just received the safe, effective COVID vaccine following continuity-of-government protocols. Vaccines are how we beat this virus.  Now back to continue fighting for a rescue package including a lot more money for distribution so more Americans can receive it as fast as possible.  https://t.co/kSBhI3EzzM
1339726771504226309 2020-12-17 19:18:47 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The only way to beat this pandemic is for us to follow the advice of our nation’s health care professionals: get vaccinated and continue to follow CDC guidelines.    My full statement:  https://t.co/EJrC7f5lwq
1339702999837532161 2020-12-17 17:44:20 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Productive conversations remain underway on COVID-19 relief. But Congress must not slide into treating these talks like routine negotiations at our routine pace.  This could not be more urgent. The Senate’s going to keep working right through the weekend until we get an outcome.  https://t.co/aXGTFunsPH
1339618327770116102 2020-12-17 12:07:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The American people have struggled heroically through this pandemic. They’ve already waited too long for more relief.   The Senate isn’t going anywhere until our bipartisan discussions reach an outcome for the American people.
1339229321785905154 2020-12-16 10:22:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The American people need more help. We need vaccine distribution money. We need to re-up the Paycheck Protection Program to save jobs. We need to continue to provide for laid-off Americans.  Congressional leaders on both sides are going to keep working until we get it done.
1338940496677318658 2020-12-15 15:14:25 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> As a polio survivor, I am a huge supporter of vaccinations. Whenever my turn comes, I will absolutely take the vaccine and do my part to reassure anyone who’s doubtful. It’s the right thing to do for yourself, for your family, and for the country.  https://t.co/xsHidTzN4s
1338849288894509059 2020-12-15 09:11:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Attorney General Barr is one of the most dedicated and capable public servants I have ever seen in action. He has helped keep America safe from criminals and terrorists and advanced the bedrock American value of equal justice under law. My full statement:  https://t.co/j5p7md8zy4
1337594714615390209 2020-12-11 22:06:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Thanks to the genius of science, the historic success of Operation Warp Speed, and the bold action of the Trump Administration, this should mark the beginning of the end of this terrible chapter.   What an announcement.
1337464336453955584 2020-12-11 13:28:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate just passed the National Defense Authorization Act. This annual bill will unlock the training, tools, and cutting-edge equipment that our servicemembers and civilian employees need as they bravely defend American lives and American interests.  https://t.co/iaAEbtxoAt
1337156852493258752 2020-12-10 17:06:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today I am announcing the Senate swearing in day for the 117th Congress will be Sunday, January 3rd at 12:00 pm.
1337115934960586752 2020-12-10 14:24:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Trial lawyers are among Democrats’ most reliable sources of campaign cash.  Coincidentally, Democrats say they'd rather not pass *any* more aid (PPP, vaccine distribution, jobless aid) than limit the opportunity for the plaintiffs’ bar to suck money from our nation’s re-opening.
1336737127426613251 2020-12-09 13:19:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Yesterday, Democrats rejected two more GOP aid proposals in the space of two hours.  I’ve proposed we set aside remaining sticking points and pass everything we agree on. They say “no.”  And they now admit they blocked aid all summer &amp; fall because there was an upcoming election.
1336059945964466176 2020-12-07 16:28:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate knows all about end-of-year drama, but this time the stakes could not be higher. Americans are struggling under the weight of this pandemic. Democrats need to let Congress do our job &amp; pass more relief.  We have so much common ground. Let's make law. Let's get it done.
1334985634373660672 2020-12-04 17:19:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Everyone understands this has been a challenging time for local leaders, but pandemics do not erase our First Amendment rights. I am glad that @kyoag is leading the way to defend the religious liberty of Kentuckians and all Americans.  https://t.co/1FtSX7w0mr
1334180452719063046 2020-12-02 11:59:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans have spent months proposing more COVID relief. Yesterday I put forward yet another proposal that would invest many billions in workers, laid-off Americans, small businesses, &amp; vaccine distribution.    I hope Democrats will finally let us get a bipartisan outcome soon.
1333909118269198344 2020-12-01 18:01:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Attorney General Barr was absolutely right to appoint John Durham to be a Special Counsel on this matter. The nation deserves to know the truth about the egregious abuses of power that took place in 2016 and deserves that justice be done to anyone who broke the law.
1333515616792272896 2020-11-30 15:57:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The American people need more help now. Congress should deliver more COVID relief this year.  Even House and Senate Democrats are publicly saying that Speaker Pelosi's and Leader Schumer's all-or-nothing obstruction needs to stop.
1331945811043905536 2020-11-26 08:00:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We are blessed to live in the greatest country the world has ever known. Even in a trying year unlike anything we’ve seen before, we are constantly reminded why. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.  https://t.co/TkQfXbq5F2
1329882406602616835 2020-11-20 15:20:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our country badly needs the kinds of targeted, urgent COVID relief that Republicans have been trying to pass for months — from job-saving PPP funding to vaccine distribution.   My full statement:  https://t.co/ybJ2OJSYf9
1329170133588303878 2020-11-18 16:10:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> For months, Republicans have tried to make bipartisan progress on huge areas of COVID relief where there's no disagreement.  Vaccine distribution funds.  Another round of the PPP for hard-hit small businesses.   But Democrats blocked it all over their unrelated liberal wish-list.
1329113012410736642 2020-11-18 12:23:30 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> .@ChuckGrassley had not missed a single vote in 27 years. Yesterday he paused that streak, on doctors’ orders, while awaiting a COVID test result.    The Senate is praying for continued good health for our president pro tempore and looking forward to seeing him again soon.
1328859637056204801 2020-11-17 19:36:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans have tried for weeks to pass another targeted rescue package. It would send hundreds of billions of dollars to schools, unemployment aid, another round of the job-saving PPP, and healthcare.   Democrats repeatedly blocked it all. Let's hope they let us make law soon.
1328787118173413377 2020-11-17 14:48:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Another Democrat demand that’s blocked bipartisan aid: The fixation on a massive slush fund for state &amp; city govt's, unlinked from COVID need.  Some states are taking in more tax revenue this fall than they did before the pandemic.   It's struggling families who need urgent help.
1328756703899344907 2020-11-17 12:47:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats’ so-called “HEROES Act” is so unserious that it was condemned by the Speaker's own moderate Democrats the instant she put it out.   Huge tax cuts for rich people in blue states, but no second round of the Paycheck Protection Program? Those are their priorities?
1328478281067339777 2020-11-16 18:21:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Months ago, skeptics dismissed President Trump’s aggressive timelines for vaccines. But our scientists are making history, with a huge assist from Operation Warp Speed. It's sped up research &amp; laid groundwork for fast distribution once a vaccine is confirmed safe and effective.
1328469477919518729 2020-11-16 17:46:19 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> More huge news this morning in COVID-19 vaccine development. The kinds of headlines we've longed for.  But we must stay careful for the next weeks and months. Wear our masks. Keep social distance. We've come this far and victory is in sight. Let's not surrender to the virus now.
1328452760677851142 2020-11-16 16:39:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Trump Administration has made huge strides in the Middle East: taking out terrorist leaders, brokering historic deals, &amp; moving US forces into support roles as Afghans lead the fight for their country.  Premature retreat would put this record at risk.  https://t.co/egVaLJSIlS
1326996921450377218 2020-11-12 16:14:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It is sad to see leading Democrats including some Governors treat the vaccine news like a mixed blessing because it occurred under a Republican administration. Some things must be bigger than politics.  Leaders should be cheering this on, not baselessly undermining science.
1326940487979130880 2020-11-12 12:30:40 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This week’s news on a COVID-19 vaccine was incredibly promising. All of us have to keep up commonsense precautions in the meantime. The virus is spreading quickly in Kentucky and nationwide, and it doesn’t care whether we’ve gotten bored with wearing masks or social distancing.
1326509804479795202 2020-11-11 07:59:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today, we reflect on the heroism of America’s veterans and those currently serving in uniform.  From the Greatest Generation to our 21st-century fighting force, we owe all veterans our gratitude and respect.   Happy Veterans Day.  https://t.co/TL2cI46ESm
1326261033099550722 2020-11-10 15:30:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This news confirms what Republicans have said for months:  Our country needs more smart, focused relief that is targeted to schools, healthcare, small businesses, &amp; those who are hurting the most.  Not the absurd multi-trillion-dollar socialist wish-lists Democrats have demanded.
1326261032193495041 2020-11-10 15:30:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> American workers are rebuilding our economy stronger &amp; faster than anyone predicted.   Experts predicted double-digit unemployment into 2021. Instead, it’s down to 6.9%. More than 630k new jobs just last month.   Too many are still hurting. Our work isn't done. But what progress.
1326221204223627269 2020-11-10 12:52:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Grateful to my Senate Republican colleagues for their unanimous confidence in me to continue serving as Leader. We have a lot more to do to continue fighting for working families and strengthening our great country.  https://t.co/Vh8yNkC3Pl
1326190968001978370 2020-11-10 10:52:20 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Yesterday, we learned one COVID-19 vaccine candidate may be more than 90% effective.   This huge good news is a testament to the ingenuity of the American private sector and the historic groundwork laid by Congress and the Trump Administration.  https://t.co/TtcD2TpmJC
1324697471654789120 2020-11-06 07:57:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Here’s how this must work in our great country: Every legal vote should be counted. Any illegally-submitted ballots must not. All sides must get to observe the process. And the courts are here to apply the laws &amp; resolve disputes.  That's how Americans' votes decide the result.
1322297837124812801 2020-10-30 18:02:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI: I joined @hughhewitt to discuss confirming Justice Barrett to the Supreme Court and Democrats’ threats against our governing  institutions:  https://t.co/ArVnvccID9
1321904827232825345 2020-10-29 16:00:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now: I am joining @guypbenson to discuss the Senate’s successful confirmation of Justice Barrett to the Supreme Court.  https://t.co/HC2JtVXHgB
1321121679582629894 2020-10-27 12:08:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI: I joined @ShannonBream to discuss confirming Justice Barrett to the Supreme Court, Democrats’ continued threats to pack the courts, and Speaker Pelosi continuing to block COVID-19 relief.  https://t.co/NCA7FsTxzQ
1320924145983627264 2020-10-26 23:03:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now: I’m joining @ShannonBream on @FoxNews to discuss the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States.
1320879515040681986 2020-10-26 20:06:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate just confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States.  One of the most impressive nominees for public office in a generation will serve for life on our highest court.  https://t.co/qkJ0FPbTv1
1320427990552117250 2020-10-25 14:12:19 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate just voted to advance one of the most qualified nominees in generations. Judge Barrett’s intellectual brilliance, integrity, and commitment to impartiality are above reproach.   Tomorrow, we will vote to confirm the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
1320071148906885127 2020-10-24 14:34:22 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> More coronavirus resources are on the way to Kentucky. With the help of @HHSGov &amp; @usedgov, Kentucky students &amp; teachers will receive more than two million masks.   One of the most important things we can do to protect ourselves &amp; others is to wear a mask.  https://t.co/1AtyoYmush
1320055677839151111 2020-10-24 13:32:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats cannot use “illegitimate” as a synonym for “we didn’t get our way.”  Democrats keep demanding the President repeat that the election will be valid even if he dislikes the outcome. But they're flunking that test badly with Judge Barrett's nomination.  https://t.co/Lvf0DtlA6Y
1319989763319992322 2020-10-24 09:10:58 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> For the third time this year, the Trump administration’s efforts have guided an historic step forward in the Middle East. Yesterday’s announcement of normalized relations between Israel and Sudan is good news for peace-loving people everywhere.
1319381029451403276 2020-10-22 16:52:04 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> With no good arguments to stop Judge Barrett, Democrats have resorted to blatant falsehoods. Inventing fake Lincoln quotes. Lying about this moving faster than many past confirmations.  Facts, not falsehoods, are going to carry the day in the Senate.  https://t.co/pxAeYmkfn6
1319346422035238914 2020-10-22 14:34:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now: I’m joining @DanaPerino on @FoxNews to discuss Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court and Democrats’ continued blockade of COVID-19 relief for struggling Americans.
1319336882216472576 2020-10-22 13:56:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This morning, the Judiciary Committee reported Judge Barrett’s nomination to the Senate floor. Their unanimous recommendation was that she be confirmed.   This nomination will receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor in the next several days.
1319007920416264195 2020-10-21 16:09:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our Constitution forbids disqualifying people from public service due to their religious beliefs. The far left has either forgotten this or just doesn’t care. It only underscores why we need well-informed jurists like Judge Barrett to protect our Constitution &amp; Americans’ rights.  https://t.co/9iCPWs3V7P
1318973782606946310 2020-10-21 13:53:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Democrats just used the filibuster — which they say they dislike — to kill another coronavirus relief package.   Unemployment benefits. PPP. Testing. Vaccines. School funding. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions.   Every Democrat just voted to block it all.
1318960373639172101 2020-10-21 13:00:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> NOW: The Senate is voting on another rescue package for American families.  Testing. Treatments. Vaccines. Unemployment aid. Another PPP. Historic money for schools. Find common ground &amp; get help out the door.  We'll see if Democrats use the filibuster to kill the bill.
1318958973144489989 2020-10-21 12:54:58 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats have said we shouldn’t pass any more relief at all unless Speaker Pelosi gets her whole far-left wish list, including all kinds of non-COVID-related demands.   Working families in Kentucky and around the country deserve better than this obstruction.
1318647847546474501 2020-10-20 16:18:40 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Paycheck Protection Program has made a critical difference for millions of working families. Today, I’m having the Senate vote on a new second round for the hardest-hit small businesses.   Democrats say they support the PPP. Let’s see how they vote.
1318601864926081025 2020-10-20 13:15:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats have delayed aid for months over non-COVID-related liberal demands. Last night, Leader Schumer even tried to adjourn the Senate for three weeks. Americans need help; Democrats just want to go home.   We are voting on more aid this week.
1318341206858977281 2020-10-19 20:00:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Speaker Pelosi’s all-or-nothing act has kept Americans waiting for months. We badly need Congress to agree where we can, get money out the door now, and keep arguing over the Speaker’s non-COVID-related wish list later.  We'll vote on hundreds of billions in more aid this week.
1318312942438408193 2020-10-19 18:07:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Last week, Judge Barrett proved she has the deep legal expertise, judicial temperament, and intellectual horsepower that Americans deserve to have on the Supreme Court. The Senate will turn to her nomination as soon as it comes out of committee later this week.
1317571617837490184 2020-10-17 17:02:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I just announced the Senate will vote next week on hundreds of billions more dollars for relief programs that Democrats do not even oppose. Working families have already waited too long for Speaker Pelosi’s Marie Antoinette act to stop. Let's make law.  https://t.co/iR7OYKuCKw
1317148869877268480 2020-10-16 13:02:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Judge Barrett exhibited every bit of the intellectual brilliance, legal expertise, and open-minded judicial temperament that we need on the Supreme Court. I will proudly vote to confirm her. The Senate will take up her nomination as soon as it comes out of Committee.  https://t.co/KkOGo0JVKL
1316450548854468609 2020-10-14 14:47:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It is bizarre to watch Vice President Biden and Democrats refuse to give a straight answer on their own party’s threats to pack the Supreme Court. But it is even more absurd for them to try to redefine “court-packing” to mean any judicial confirmation that disappoints Democrats.  https://t.co/RpZbaXNO2m
1316051684892827650 2020-10-13 12:22:27 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We don’t agree with Speaker Pelosi that “nothing” is better than “something” for workers.  Senators will vote on more relief next week, including more PPP money to stop layoffs. We’ll be able to pass it before we turn to Judge Barrett's nomination unless Democrats block it again.  https://t.co/paJFhx5HcI
1316048753510449152 2020-10-13 12:10:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Judge Barrett is just as brilliant and impressive as advertised. She is clearly qualified. She’s committed to fairness and impartiality. And she clearly understands the job of a judge under the Constitution is to apply the law and not impose personal policy views.
1315315247675330560 2020-10-11 11:36:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The far left has been threatening our basic institutions of government since long before this Supreme Court vacancy. When today’s Democrats lose one election or one vote on the Senate floor, they start threatening to tear up the rulebook.  https://t.co/CT3rnShGZD
1314728749330509827 2020-10-09 20:45:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Judge Barrett is a stellar nominee. I think the president picked the single best person he could have picked anywhere in the country. This is a woman of extraordinary achievement.  https://t.co/E1pyp1PPHU
1313858790924726272 2020-10-07 11:08:40 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI: I joined @marthamaccallum to discuss the Senate’s months of success with hybrid hearings, Judge Barrett’s outstanding qualifications, and Democrats’ refusal to get serious on COVID-19 relief talks.  https://t.co/QrBro8587T
1313813018241896449 2020-10-07 08:06:47 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media on Judge Barrett’s faith are a disgrace. They demean the confirmation process, disrespect the Constitution, and insult millions of American believers.  https://t.co/Qg5mFQzWFO
1313501399632748544 2020-10-06 11:28:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> President Trump made an outstanding choice in Judge Amy Coney Barrett. She is one of the finest legal minds of her generation. She’s won national admiration for her example of strong female leadership. She’s exactly the kind of person Americans deserve on their highest Court.  https://t.co/eYEle2s1nw
1313275429894135808 2020-10-05 20:30:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Judge Barrett’s hearings will begin one week from today. Chairman Graham has all the tools to conduct a hybrid hearing, just like the 150 others the Senate has held this year.   We will not stop working for the American people because Democrats are afraid they may lose a vote.
1313248059766255621 2020-10-05 18:41:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats say they’ll try everything to stall Judge Barrett. The latest excuse: Hybrid hearings with some virtual participation are suddenly bad.   The Senate has held 150 of these hybrid hearings since May. Democrats have taken advantage of the tools. They’ve praised the format.
1312488017148346369 2020-10-03 16:21:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Just had another great call with @POTUS. He sounds well and says he’s feeling good. We talked about the people’s business — fighting the pandemic, confirming Judge Barrett, and strengthening the economy for American families. Let’s keep our President &amp; First Lady in our prayers.
1312441098757836801 2020-10-03 13:15:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate floor proceedings will be postponed until October 19th. The @SenJudiciary confirmation hearings for Judge Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court will convene on October 12th as scheduled by Chairman Graham. My full statement:  https://t.co/7ThKZPJBZG
1312076870645620737 2020-10-02 13:07:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI: I joined @HughHewitt this morning to discuss Judge Barrett’s outstanding qualifications, the decision by some on the left to attack her religious faith, and the Democrats’ ongoing threats against our governing institutions.  https://t.co/Ze5EbW63qH
1312042678217998338 2020-10-02 10:52:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Just finished a great phone call with @POTUS. He’s in good spirits and we talked business — especially how impressed Senators are with the qualifications of Judge Barrett. Full steam ahead with the fair, thorough, timely process that the nominee, the Court, &amp; the country deserve.
1312006437376319489 2020-10-02 08:28:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Happy to hear the White House physician’s report that @POTUS and @FLOTUS are feeling well following their positive tests for COVID-19. Let’s continue to pray today and every day for our President and our First Lady and for all those impacted by COVID-19.
1311789406139887616 2020-10-01 18:05:40 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now to @BretBaier. I’ll be discussing Judge Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court and the Democrats’ ongoing obstruction of more bipartisan COVID-19 relief.
1311430098239750150 2020-09-30 18:17:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Everyone who knows Judge Barrett, across the political spectrum, praises her independence and impartiality.  A judge's job is to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead. Nothing more, nothing less.  It's revealing how much this basic concept seems to scare the far left.
1311392341585022977 2020-09-30 15:47:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats want to pack the Supreme Court. Vice President Biden refused to rule it out last night. Now Senate Democrats are demanding promises and pre-commitments from Judge Barrett.   Judicial independence is vital to the rule of law. Why are Republicans alone in defending it?
1311350246547623938 2020-09-30 13:00:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Judge Barrett is an exemplary judge and a qualified nominee for the Supreme Court. Her legal peers across the political spectrum praise her independence, fair-mindedness, and impartiality. That is exactly what the American people deserve on their highest Court.  https://t.co/Eawb6JuCeX
1311088540546207749 2020-09-29 19:40:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Multiple times, with multiple nominees, Senate Democrats have said or implied that certain personal religious beliefs make Americans unfit to serve. Judge Barrett in 2017 was only one example. Now the media’s joining in.  These tactics need to stop now.  https://t.co/wisPUKXe2O
1311029507860684801 2020-09-29 15:46:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Barrett earlier today. President Trump has nominated exactly the kind of outstanding person whom the American people deserve to have on their highest Court.  https://t.co/0tTJqPwpeP
1309963158182932487 2020-09-26 17:08:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court.   A brilliant scholar. An exemplary judge. President Trump could not have made a better decision.  https://t.co/FKadx6TJeU
1309327299653906432 2020-09-24 23:02:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in: I’m about to join @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight for my first interview on the Supreme Court vacancy. The Senate will do what we did in 2016: Follow history, follow precedent, and do the job we were elected to do.
1309238722119032835 2020-09-24 17:10:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The far left called John Paul Stevens anti-woman. They said Anthony Kennedy would turn back the clock. David Souter was going to hurt “women, minorities, dissenters, &amp; other groups" from the bench.   Anyone doubt the same old smears will be rearing their heads starting Saturday?
1309198438056316931 2020-09-24 14:30:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We don’t know which legal all-star the President will nominate on Saturday. So isn't it curious that everyone already knows exactly what smears and scare tactics the far left will trot out?   Their playbook has not changed for 45 years. The nominee is irrelevant to their attacks.
1309169766528057347 2020-09-24 12:36:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> My full statement on Breonna Taylor, yesterday’s announcement, and the violence overnight in my hometown of Louisville:  https://t.co/NN70M9oun8
1309126971058794499 2020-09-24 09:46:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.
1308889364726939654 2020-09-23 18:01:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats’ first government funding bill intentionally left rural America behind. But @SenJoniErnst and other Republicans did not let the Democrats defund farm country. They secured the Commodity Credit Corporation funding that our farmers and ranchers depend on.
1308813662925316096 2020-09-23 13:01:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Yesterday, Sen. Schumer decided to vent his frustration by blocking a bipartisan Intelligence Committee meeting on counterintelligence with a leading expert on protecting our elections.  A partisan temper tantrum is one thing. Jeopardizing national security is a different story.
1308554682667859968 2020-09-22 19:52:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Rewarding Democrats’ tactics now would not stop their attacks on our institutions. Their threats predate this new vacancy by over a year.   Their recklessness only underscores the importance that we do our job and confirm a nominee who truly respects the Constitution.
1308513764925485057 2020-09-22 17:09:27 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats are threatening to attack the foundations of the Senate and the Court if they do not get their way.   Here's the problem with this attempted blackmail: They have already been making these threats for many months. They've been campaigning on them for over a year.
1308475058847993857 2020-09-22 14:35:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our Senate majority will do exactly the same thing in 2020 that we did in 2016: Follow Senate history, follow the clear precedent in each situation, and do exactly the job we were elected to do.   We are going to vote on President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court this year.
1308157376734863360 2020-09-21 17:33:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a generational legal giant and a trailblazing champion for American women. The Senate is grieving with the nation, praying for her family, and remembering her historic legacy.  My full Senate floor remarks:  https://t.co/mfVTHURqIw
1308090170860855298 2020-09-21 13:06:14 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats’ rough draft of a government funding bill shamefully leaves out key relief and support that American farmers need. This is no time to add insult to injury and defund help for farmers and rural America.
1307121192516628480 2020-09-18 20:55:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate and the nation mourn the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary American life.  My full statement:  https://t.co/NOwYLhDxIk
1307041290903789573 2020-09-18 15:38:22 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today we honor National POW/MIA Recognition Day. More than 1300 patriotic Kentuckians still haven’t come home. They are not forgotten, and we are still searching.
1306961755017543681 2020-09-18 10:22:19 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI: I joined the @GuyBensonShow to discuss Speaker Pelosi holding up relief for Americans, Senate Democrats’ filibuster hypocrisy, and Democrats playing politics with election security.  https://t.co/ioFcheGe0P
1306678061895647233 2020-09-17 15:35:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In 2019, under Republican policies:  - Fastest annual growth in household income on record - Working-class &amp; middle-class families saw more of the gains - Poverty lowest since 1950s   That's the leadership our nation will need as we rebuild after COVID.  https://t.co/Byrmh3DgD8
1306314676402376705 2020-09-16 15:31:03 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It’s been less than a year since my bill with Senator Kaine and @SenToddYoung raised the nationwide age for tobacco purchases to 21. We just learned there’s already been a major decline in e-cigarette use among young people. Huge bipartisan progress for the health of our kids.  https://t.co/yosvf0SA56
1306247560852631559 2020-09-16 11:04:22 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Even Speaker Pelosi’s own House Democrats are sick of her blocking COVID-19 relief.  But she insists anything short of her multi-trillion wish list would make Democrats “a cheap date.” What a joke.  People are hurting. They need help. Not the Speaker's pointless political games.
1305909721082331136 2020-09-15 12:41:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today is an historic day for Middle East peace. Landmark agreements formalized at the White House between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain. Thanks to the U.S. and the Trump administration, the winds of change are blowing across toward progress and peace.
1305660009624240132 2020-09-14 20:09:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The framers designed the Senate to be the country’s firewall against bad ideas and radical change. If Democrats are afraid their bad ideas could never meet the bar, it’s their proposals that need to be scrapped, not our country’s checks and balances.
1305638804032811015 2020-09-14 18:45:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Great news: Experts have found a huge decline in teen vaping. This is just what we sought with my landmark legislation to increase the required age for all tobacco products to 21. Health officials say that law made a big difference.  https://t.co/dqhz6fhQwg
1305615661008408578 2020-09-14 17:13:25 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Trump administration has helped secured two historic peace agreements between Israel and Arab nations in just the last few days. The winds of change are blowing and the Middle East is changing for the better. My full statement:  https://t.co/FDbUKWrCpN
1305592763082248193 2020-09-14 15:42:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Democrats are threatening to blow up the filibuster if they gain power and ram far-left policies through the Senate. But they just used the filibuster last week to block COVID relief. They used it this summer to kill @SenatorTimScott’s police reform bill.  Total hypocrisy.
1305560825466359808 2020-09-14 13:35:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> All military families serve alongside their loved ones in uniform. The new Gold Star Families Memorial in Owensboro, KY commemorates the sacrifices these patriots made in the name of freedom. The nation can never repay our debt. But we can keep these families in our prayers.  https://t.co/5bZkjgwqlB
1304810135882272768 2020-09-12 11:52:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Washington Democrats have now blocked two separate proposals to provide hundreds of billions of dollars for safe schools, jobs, and healthcare. They just do not want American families getting more help before the election. Pure cynicism.
1304400335717437441 2020-09-11 08:44:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Nineteen years ago, thousands of Americans were murdered by terrorists. National landmarks burned. Brave first responders put their lives on the line to save strangers.   May we never fail to honor them. And may we never tire of our pledge: Never Again.  https://t.co/95QqWlm05m
1304187017731940352 2020-09-10 18:36:30 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI I joined @DanaPerino to discuss Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer's continued efforts to block coronavirus relief funding for Americans.    Every Senator who voted against relief needs to answer what in the proposal they actually disagreed with. Kids? Jobs? Healthcare?  https://t.co/iuGc7fN01A
1304107662750158848 2020-09-10 13:21:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Every Senate Democrat just voted against hundreds of billions of dollars of COVID-19 relief. They blocked money for schools, testing, vaccines, unemployment insurance, and the Paycheck Protection Program.  Their goal is clear: No help for American families before the election.
1304102357668712450 2020-09-10 13:00:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Yesterday, reporters asked Sen. Schumer whether by refusing to compromise, he was making the perfect the enemy of the good. His response? “Republicans are the enemy of the good.”  Americans are not enemies. COVID-19 is our enemy. It's time for Washington Democrats to act like it.
1304077570258997248 2020-09-10 11:21:35 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate is voting today on COVID-19 relief. Hundreds of billions more dollars to make schools safe for kids, to keep workers getting paid, and to invest in treatments and vaccines.  American families will see exactly which Senators want to send them more bipartisan help.
1303836621826121728 2020-09-09 19:24:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer were attacking our new COVID proposal before they’d even read it.  They’re attacking it over provisions that literally have Democrat cosponsors.  They just don't want Americans getting another cent of bipartisan relief before the November election.
1303791960973606916 2020-09-09 16:26:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The coronavirus doesn't care about our election. But it's clear that's all Democrats care about. Look at the facts and ask each Democrat what in the proposal that we're voting on tomorrow they actually disagree with.   More historic funding for schools? Jobs? Healthcare?  https://t.co/p38BQjgvKM
1303749151222530051 2020-09-09 13:36:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This year’s Kentucky Derby showed our great traditions can adapt to overcome any challenge. But our sport must be protected.   I’ve been proud to stand up for horseracing throughout my career. Today, I’m introducing new legislation to keep up that support.  https://t.co/3sU5juOUCI
1303702948464205825 2020-09-09 10:32:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans will not let Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer kill COVID relief behind closed doors without putting every Senator on the record.  Tomorrow, we'll vote to protect workers' paychecks, keep kids safe in school, and win the healthcare fight against the virus.
1303502554358329345 2020-09-08 21:16:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans have built yet another effort to help Americans. Money for schools. Resources for parents. Testing. Vaccines. Another round of the job-saving PPP. And more.  The Senate will be voting this week. The nation will see who's serious about making law for American families.
1303479750623727618 2020-09-08 19:46:04 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats have blocked any new COVID relief, saying anything short of their entire far-left wish list is “piecemeal” and “emaciated.”   The same Democrats rushed back to D.C. to pass piecemeal legislation for the Postal Service that did nothing at all for working families.
1303458251078594563 2020-09-08 18:20:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans have spent months fighting for more COVID-19 relief. We proposed a major $1T bill. Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer said no. We suggested smaller bipartisan deals. They said no again.   Today we put forward yet another proposal. They attacked it before even reading it.
1303320716071383040 2020-09-08 09:14:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans and Democrats have big differences, but they should not stop us from agreeing where we can and making law to help Americans through this crisis. Working families cannot suffer more because Democrats think their pain helps them politically. The Senate is going to vote.  https://t.co/HzbPxvRe9I
1303320637633687553 2020-09-08 09:13:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> But Republicans are not done fighting for the American people. Today our majority is introducing a targeted proposal for kids, jobs, and healthcare to help with many of our most urgent challenges. No more obstruction behind closed doors. Every Senator will be going on the record.  https://t.co/N7QdjXrQql
1303320570654855168 2020-09-08 09:13:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans have been trying for months to deliver more COVID-19 relief to American families. Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer have blocked us at every turn. Every action has suggested they simply do not want families to get any more bipartisan help before the election.  https://t.co/nEPUDXBzIt
1302194356754042880 2020-09-05 06:38:22 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> As Kentuckians, Thoroughbred racing is practically in our bones. It’s who we are. We find our state’s unique history on the track &amp; in the stables. This year's 146th Kentucky Derby is going to look a little different, but the sun will keep shining bright on My Old Kentucky Home.  https://t.co/ZjJPcGX5kj
1302007726671790080 2020-09-04 18:16:46 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> My Old Kentucky Home is our state song. I applaud Churchill Downs for keeping our tradition alive. “Cancel culture” cannot be allowed to destroy our history without so much as a real discussion.  https://t.co/sZmRM8DO1l
1301522988299419650 2020-09-03 10:10:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’m the only one of the four congressional leaders not from New York or California. It’s my job to look out for Middle America, especially my favorite state: Kentucky.  https://t.co/8U79gAi6Vi
1300921017016123392 2020-09-01 18:18:35 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The most important things each of us can do to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 are to wear a mask and practice social distancing.  https://t.co/wTwvx8VvJy
1300791211050008576 2020-09-01 09:42:46 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’m proud to be joined by prominent horseracing leaders in Kentucky as they take the courageous step to protect jobs and increase safety standards for horses, jockeys, trainers, breeders, and fans. I’m grateful to @RepAndyBarr for his strong leadership.  https://t.co/wXIfr0HR7s
1298777000308596736 2020-08-26 20:19:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> To my Democratic colleagues: The coronavirus doesn't have a stake in this election. Struggling families across America need our help, and Republicans stand ready to deliver.  https://t.co/97iN3ul3cL
1298302986268155906 2020-08-25 12:55:27 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> From Mammoth Cave in KY to the 400+ parks nationwide, I wish the @NatlParkService a happy birthday. Thanks to the Great American Outdoors Act, the NPS will stand the test of time for generations. I encourage everyone to get outside, socially distance, and explore these treasures.  https://t.co/UihV7dxIc0
1298009672889311239 2020-08-24 17:29:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The coronavirus does not care about the election. Struggling Americans need our help now, and that can only happen if Washington Democrats stop playing games and actually help the American people.  https://t.co/Xy2ixCAE7A
1297978166452133890 2020-08-24 15:24:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> From homegrown hemp masks to distilleries making hand sanitizer, Kentuckians are leading by example. We’re going to keep working together to beat this virus.  https://t.co/ll44Cdk9k5
1297338939657814016 2020-08-22 21:04:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans are committed to making sure the Postal Service remains well equipped to fulfill its important duties. But the Senate will not pass stand-alone legislation for the Postal Service while American families continue to go without the help they need.
1297318542493257729 2020-08-22 19:43:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> If Washington Democrats would devote half the energy they spend worrying about their own re-elections to actually helping the American people, we could easily achieve the kind of targeted, bipartisan relief package that Republicans have wanted for weeks.
1297304651998670849 2020-08-22 18:48:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats have spent weeks ignoring the urgent needs of American workers and families, but they rushed back to Washington the instant that overblown conspiracy theories about the U.S. Postal Service convinced them their own jobs might be in jeopardy. My full statement:  https://t.co/41VdckTLw0
1295734888679841792 2020-08-18 10:50:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Russia, China, Iran, and others want to undermine Americans’ confidence in our institutions. I applaud the Intelligence Committee’s in-depth investigation and the steps Congress, this Administration, and the Intelligence Community have taken to defend us.  https://t.co/j7pmD6u742
1295441718289076224 2020-08-17 15:25:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Delivering for Kentucky is my highest priority in the Senate. With the support I secured, renovations to the Rochester Dam will make sure the drinking water is safe and abundant.  https://t.co/1UgV7mrCzo
1294009190244134920 2020-08-13 16:33:27 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> No family in middle America is saying: "Thank goodness the Democrats are blocking cash payments to me, money for my kids’ schools, and money for vaccines until Manhattan millionaires get a tax cut!"  What American families everywhere want is an outcome.  https://t.co/wsoLaPKaH5
1293980240180584450 2020-08-13 14:38:24 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats’ latest spin: They’ve moved from a $3.5 trillion, far-left, non-COVID-related wish list to a $2.5 trillion, far-left, non-COVID-related wish list and insist the White House meet them there.  That’s not a reality-based negotiation. It’s throwing spaghetti at the wall.  https://t.co/QmHTA0WdMu
1293960626293878785 2020-08-13 13:20:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> President Trump deserves great credit for bringing about this historic step forward for the Middle East. The commitment to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates represents tremendous progress toward greater peace and prosperity across the region.  https://t.co/uFTatL2xDa
1293603582772731907 2020-08-12 13:41:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The PPP saved Main Street jobs across Kentucky. It sent more than $5B in payroll support to our state. But the recovery is not finished. Hard-hit businesses need a second draw, and Republicans proposed one.  But Democrats are blocking it over non-COVID-related wish-list items.
1293338382043680771 2020-08-11 20:07:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Americans need relief, and that means focusing on what’s directly related to COVID-19: Kids, jobs, healthcare, and legal protections for re-opening.  I applaud the President for taking action during this emergency to get help to Americans who are struggling.  https://t.co/5xatB6FalX
1293306719062224897 2020-08-11 18:02:04 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Speaker &amp; Democratic Leader say not another dime for testing, treatments, or vaccines unless they get a huge tax cut for blue-state millionaires.   Taking our health system hostage over longtime, non-COVID-related, liberal demands.   This is a crisis. Let's govern like it.
1293260812841357313 2020-08-11 14:59:40 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now to @FoxNews: I’m joining @BillHemmer to discuss Democrats’ decision to play hardball with vulnerable Americans who need help and hurt our nation’s chance to get on offense against the virus.
1293234961064001536 2020-08-11 13:16:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Speaker and the Democratic Leader say they won’t allow another cent for families, schools, or the PPP unless they get a trillion-dollar state government slush fund, way beyond COVID needs.   These unrelated liberal demands are blocking billions in aid that families need now.
1293209454616481797 2020-08-11 11:35:35 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The New York Times proclaims Democrats are “Playing Hardball on Coronavirus Relief.”   “Playing” is right — they’re treating this like a political game.   Families are suffering. Americans are dying. This isn’t a game, it’s a crisis. Our country needs Democrats to act like it.
1292932055521792002 2020-08-10 17:13:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Because of Democrats’ obstruction, the extra federal unemployment aid expired. The PPP is closed with no second round in sight. No new money for testing or schools. No second round of checks to families. Democrats held all this hostage for non-COVID-related liberal priorities.
1292915172156334080 2020-08-10 16:06:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I hoped this week we’d be finalizing major legislation. After all, American families are struggling and need help. But Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer decided not to deliver. I am glad the president stepped in to soften the blow of their hostage tactics.
1292225797894418439 2020-08-08 18:26:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Struggling Americans need action now. I am glad that President Trump is proving that while Democrats use laid-off workers as political pawns, Republicans will actually look out for them. My full statement:  https://t.co/5uEu6PSUGH
1291859798368104449 2020-08-07 18:12:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I appreciate Director Evanina’s report on foreign powers’ efforts to divide us and interfere in our politics. I am confident American voters will reject the fear-mongering that seeks to undermine confidence in our elections. My full statement:  https://t.co/3YzvOFsbOy
1291433442740240384 2020-08-06 13:58:21 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Some predicted weeks ago that Democratic leaders did not actually want another bipartisan rescue package to pass, and would sabotage negotiations by refusing to come an inch toward the White House in these talks. Have Americans seen anything at all to disprove that?
1291418692908126208 2020-08-06 12:59:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI, I joined @FoxNews to discuss Democrats’ obstruction of the COVID-19 relief negotiations, how Republicans tried to keep extra unemployment benefits from expiring, and the need to keep small-business aid flowing.  https://t.co/rwGyAXgzIB
1291405049424498688 2020-08-06 12:05:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats’ obstruction last week forced the additional federal unemployment benefit to expire. Their obstruction this week will force another deadline: the PPP shuts its doors Saturday. Republicans had plans to keep both from expiring. Democrats have refused them all.
1291359907699216384 2020-08-06 09:06:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now to @CNBC. I am joining @SquawkStreet to discuss Senate Republicans’ plan to help struggling Americans who are facing the mounting consequences of Democrats' inaction. Our nation needs a bipartisan outcome, and they need it now.
1291139108765655041 2020-08-05 18:28:46 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now to @FoxNews Special Report. I am joining @MikeEmanuelFox to discuss Senate Republicans’ plan to help working families, small businesses, and healthcare heroes navigate this new phase of the pandemic.
1291093092326572034 2020-08-05 15:25:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our country is facing bigger problems than whether Malibu gets to upgrade its street-sweepers. Struggling families need help now. Democratic leaders must stop blocking aid to Americans over their unrelated left-wing wish list.  https://t.co/PHu90VDeJd
1291069098475085826 2020-08-05 13:50:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I extend the Senate’s condolences to the people of Lebanon following yesterday’s horrific explosion in Beirut. My full statement:  https://t.co/VEEBeuzcwf
1291045810646507522 2020-08-05 12:18:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democratic leaders say they’ll keep blocking federal unemployment aid unless we pay people more to stay home than to work. That isn’t just bad economics, it’s unfair. We should not be taxing essential workers to pay their neighbors a higher salary to stay home.  https://t.co/tFN55kRv4P
1290726438505795584 2020-08-04 15:08:58 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We need to urgently help working families and those who’ve lost their jobs. But the Speaker and the Democratic Leader are blocking the entire rescue package over a special, unrelated tax cut for rich people in high-tax blue states.
1290674771831775232 2020-08-04 11:43:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Speaker Pelosi is still holding up this entire package over bizarre unrelated things like carveouts for the marijuana industry. She even claimed to the press that pot is a proven COVID-19 therapy!   I hope she’s shared this breakthrough with Dr. Fauci.   Can we get serious yet?
1290670854876037122 2020-08-04 11:28:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> President Trump just signed the Great American Outdoors Act into law. The GAOA will protect our country's natural treasures and promote recreation and conservation for generations — thanks to the strong leadership of @SenCoryGardner and @SteveDaines.  https://t.co/bpicVZ891j
1290656882219266052 2020-08-04 10:32:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans proposed a major rescue package: A trillion dollars for kids, jobs, and healthcare. But Democrats are blocking it all. The American people need a bipartisan outcome, not Democrats’ stonewalling behind closed doors.
1290404783896104961 2020-08-03 17:50:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate mourns the young American servicemembers who were tragically lost while training last week. Our sympathies are with their families and our gratitude is with all the personnel who led the tireless search.  https://t.co/EVvIqWp0ZA
1289238728590991363 2020-07-31 12:37:20 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans tried several ways to extend unemployment benefits. Democrats blocked them all. They're refusing any more COVID relief for anyone unless they get a massive tax cut for rich people in blue states.  The country can’t afford this cynicism. Americans need help now.
1289203601429192705 2020-07-31 10:17:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI: I joined @FoxNews @marthamaccallum to continue discussing Senate Republicans' efforts to help get kids back in school, put workers back on the clock, and equip our healthcare heroes to finish the fight.  https://t.co/zsGnedPO4a
1288955498113511424 2020-07-30 17:51:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats are holding up urgent help for struggling people over completely unrelated liberal wish-list items, like massive tax cuts for rich people in blue states. Economists across the spectrum say it’s a terrible idea. This is how serious they are about these negotiations.
1288943544976191490 2020-07-30 17:04:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI: I joined @JudyWoodruff on @NewsHour to discuss the importance of helping schools and employers safely reopen, and delivering new relief to working families in need. For the country’s sake, Democrats need to come to the table.  https://t.co/iTB5o9iHm9
1288931685732700165 2020-07-30 16:17:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans tried several ways to extend the expiring unemployment assistance. Democrats blocked them all and refused another dime for COVID-19 relief unless they get to pass a bill that includes an unrelated tax cut for rich people in blue states.  https://t.co/Vl4krLjMIr
1288867331087708161 2020-07-30 12:01:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> There’s a fact of life here in the United States Senate: It takes 60 votes to legislate. So the American people cannot get any of the additional relief that Republicans want to give them unless Democrats will come to the table.
1288534853269573633 2020-07-29 14:00:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The coronavirus does not care that we are divided. The coronavirus will not care if Washington Democrats decide it suits their partisan goals to let relief run dry.  The American people are hurting and Congress should have their backs.
1288499327174836225 2020-07-29 11:39:13 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The historic CARES Act has helped families endure this crisis. But our nation is not done with this fight. More Americans are dying. Millions are unemployed. Added federal unemployment benefits are close to expiring.  Democrats need to get serious and come to the table.
1288250680784945153 2020-07-28 19:11:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I joined @CNBC to discuss Senate Republican's HEALS Act.   The pandemic is not finished. The economic pain is not finished. So Congress cannot be finished either. Republicans are ready to govern. We just need Democrats to decide whether they are serious about making law.  https://t.co/aM30wub8rT
1288188091895873542 2020-07-28 15:02:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tune in now to @CNBC. I am joining @kaylatausche ~3:05 PM ET to discuss Senate Republicans' HEALS Act — our framework for another round of historic relief to American workers and families.
1288170841524637698 2020-07-28 13:53:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our Democratic colleagues want to pretend it is controversial that taxpayers should not pay people more not to work than the people who do go back to work. The American people don’t call that a controversy. They call that common sense. They call that basic fairness.
1288146749706698752 2020-07-28 12:18:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our nation stands at a challenging crossroads. We have one foot in this pandemic and one foot in the recovery. What the American people need is a smart, safe, and sustainable middle ground.    They need Congress’s help to construct it. That’s exactly what the HEALS Act would do.
1287897312375840768 2020-07-27 19:47:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans have created a serious framework. The question is whether Democrats will come to the table in good faith. In March, when they did, we passed the CARES Act unanimously. In June, when they didn’t, police reform collapsed.  It will take bipartisanship to make law.
1287877380040617984 2020-07-27 18:27:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We have produced a tailored and targeted bill that will address each of the three distinct crises facing our country: Getting kids back in school, getting workers back to work, and winning the healthcare fight against the virus. Kids, jobs, and healthcare.
1287867653160235009 2020-07-27 17:49:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> COVID-19 has killed nearly 150,000 Americans. 17 million people are out of work. The virus is still with us and the American people need more help. That is why Senate Republicans are introducing a new comprehensive rescue package today:  https://t.co/OKqk1ZyA2D
1287474095177728000 2020-07-26 15:45:19 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This terrible virus is still with us and America’s fight continues. Across the country, by taking commonsense steps – like wearing a mask and practicing social distancing – we’ll get through this together.  https://t.co/0BRIa8bw13
1286767425887916038 2020-07-24 16:57:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The CARES Act provided Kentucky and our nation with the tools to endure the first phase of the coronavirus crisis. But America’s fight continues, so Congress’s support for our people must continue as well. CARES 2 will focus on three things: Kids, jobs, and healthcare.  https://t.co/l70w1h7jF0
1286397143297777665 2020-07-23 16:25:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate majority has assembled a framework for CARES 2. It is tailored precisely to this phase of the crisis to deliver more relief to the American people. It represents an agreement in principle with the administration, and will be introduced next week.
1286395187623792641 2020-07-23 16:18:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our nation stands at a critical midway point in our fight against the coronavirus. Far too many families are continuing to face serious healthcare and economic challenges. So Congress’ support for our people must continue as well.
1286371226894639105 2020-07-23 14:42:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate just advanced the 60th annual National Defense Authorization Act to keep our Armed Forces on the cutting edge as they protect America, our allies, and our interest around the world.  https://t.co/FPcM4R7SgZ
1286056334027304960 2020-07-22 17:51:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The House just passed @SteveDaines and @SenCoryGardner ‘s Great American Outdoors Act. Next stop: The White House to be signed into law.  https://t.co/yRJRl1Ltpp
1286030588672004096 2020-07-22 16:09:20 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> A very happy 97th birthday to my great friend, @SenatorDole. Millions of people continue to benefit from the causes Bob championed in the Senate, and the many friends he made here join me in wishing him health and happiness in the year to come.  https://t.co/UFQhkNLeyt
1285975457461149696 2020-07-22 12:30:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today, the Senate will vote on a Democrat amendment to slash defense spending that was advertised in an op-ed titled “Defund the Pentagon.”  From defunding the police to defunding the U.S. Armed Forces.  Republicans are going to stand firm and defeat this unhinged policy.  https://t.co/h4KQfcVoyQ
1285636697573728257 2020-07-21 14:04:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The American people cannot completely stop building their lives until a vaccine is available. The U.S.A. was not built for a defensive crouch. We need to smartly, safely stand up an educational system and an economy that works for workers and families in the meantime.  https://t.co/kEtPNydhKe
1285626990414962694 2020-07-21 13:25:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> At the outset of this crisis, the Senate wrote and passed the historic, bipartisan CARES Act. It helped pull our health system and economy back from the brink. But this crisis is far from over. The American people still need help. So the Senate must act again.
1285318969746952198 2020-07-20 17:01:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. famously said “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” Our nation has bent toward justice because heroes like John Lewis took it upon themselves to lead the way. We celebrate the life of this American hero.  https://t.co/uyy3rOOn1U
1285264829473857537 2020-07-20 13:26:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our country can’t afford a second epidemic of frivolous lawsuits while we fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The next relief package should focus on four things: Jobs, healthcare, kids in school, and liability protections for those helping us fight the coronavirus.  https://t.co/cR17sxbtl1
1284528738525425665 2020-07-18 12:41:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I will never forget joining hands with John as Congress sang We Shall Overcome at a 2008 ceremony honoring his friend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It could not have been more humbling to consider what he had suffered and sacrificed so those words could be sung in that place.
1284476774185918465 2020-07-18 09:15:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate and the nation mourn the loss of Congressman John Lewis, a pioneering civil rights leader who put his life on the line to fight racism, promote equal rights, and bring our nation into greater alignment with its founding principles.
1284344881117364225 2020-07-18 00:30:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> My statement on the passing of Congressman John Lewis:  https://t.co/sFuU8cqPc8
1283814330518179842 2020-07-16 13:22:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The CARES Act didn't just give Main Street a fighting chance. The Senate’s historic legislation has also given rural healthcare and hospitals the resources they needed to keep their medical staff on the payroll and focus on fighting the coronavirus.  https://t.co/pv7PobPUzF
1283467996611121154 2020-07-15 14:26:30 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Paycheck Protection Program helped 48,000 Kentucky small businesses. From coast to coast, small businesses received emergency help to keep employees on payroll and weather the storm. I’m proud the Senate’s policy has saved millions and millions of jobs.  https://t.co/CEsKYJ8o7Z
1283113419407851528 2020-07-14 14:57:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Glad our friends and partners are stepping up to check China. Freedom-loving nations must stand together for peace, prosperity, and human rights.
1282801377757089793 2020-07-13 18:17:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Any future COVID relief package needs to be measured, with a focus on getting kids back in school safely, workers back on the job, and delivering liability protections for individuals related to the coronavirus crisis.  https://t.co/hr156jY2b2
1281312354567929856 2020-07-09 15:40:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Expanding the availability of testing is one of the best ways to slow the spread of the coronavirus. We’ve seen American ingenuity mobilize a full-scale response to this crisis and I’m grateful to the Kentuckians and American heroes who continue to step up to this challenge.  https://t.co/a1Lg1I6wgS
1280963033829969922 2020-07-08 16:32:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Kentucky’s law enforcement officers know the HIDTA program unlocks crucial resources for our fight against drug abuse. I‘m proud to have helped deliver these federal resources to Clark, Logan and Simpson Counties.  https://t.co/lAcFwHOflo  https://t.co/FdjTPxwRNB
1280653498410024960 2020-07-07 20:02:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We can’t get our country back to normal unless we have kids in school. That’s what a future COVID relief would focus on, along with jobs, healthcare, and liability protections.  https://t.co/IuFy09vDuE
1280175171521912832 2020-07-06 12:22:00 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The CARES Act is continuing to provide much-needed support to healthcare heroes in Kentucky and across America. I’m proud of the Senate’s work to make sure these critical resources are available to help our nation recover.  https://t.co/NIxqpq0xJK
1279399564366295041 2020-07-04 09:00:00 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Happy Fourth of July!   Let’s celebrate the high virtues of our nation. Let’s honor the leaders who made our country great and the sacrifices of those who defend her. And let’s never forget how incredibly proud we are to be Americans.  https://t.co/xz98TbjGbV
1278740163234017280 2020-07-02 13:19:47 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Democratic Party is increasingly saying they’ve lost patience with playing by the rules and plan to declare war on the rulebook itself.  I spoke today about the future of our nation’s governing institutions:  https://t.co/GzScB6WJWF  https://t.co/8VpLnMu4Rw
1278715706457145344 2020-07-02 11:42:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI: I joined @DanaPerino to discuss the Senate’s leading role in coronavirus relief and the importance of legal protections for doctors, nurses, schools, universities, and employers.  https://t.co/BmJF0K0OfG
1278439892717129729 2020-07-01 17:26:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Speaker has chosen to spend the House’s time this week on a cousin of the Green New Deal masquerading as a highway bill.   It will go nowhere in the Senate. Here, we’ll keep at the serious work of the nation.  https://t.co/kIokDxtLwD
1278397133905956866 2020-07-01 14:36:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN: I will be joining @DanaPerino ~2:40pm ET to discuss Senate Republicans' accomplishments and our work on coronavirus relief.
1278336917877202945 2020-07-01 10:37:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Finally. Twenty-some days and several deaths too late. The rule of law must not fade in and out with the fashions of the radical left.
1278071664945831938 2020-06-30 17:03:25 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans led the CARES Act, the biggest rescue package in American history that helped our nation weather this storm. Any further legislation will need to focus intently on kids, jobs, and healthcare, and include legal protections to help schools and businesses reopen.  https://t.co/WjooKMhtc5
1278043289174913024 2020-06-30 15:10:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> More disastrous steps by Beijing to tighten their grip on Hong Kong. Congress and the Administration have taken strong steps to stand with Hong Kong. We need to keep it up and friends of democracy around the world should join us.  https://t.co/16PrlmSM9Q
1277732942836576257 2020-06-29 18:37:27 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats' last attempt at a coronavirus response was a go-nowhere liberal wish list that even the media laughed off. With 40+ COVID hearings by the end of this week, the Senate is continuing the serious, facts-first approach that built the historic CARES Act.
1277688154053644295 2020-06-29 15:39:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We must have no stigma, none, about wearing masks when we leave our homes and come near other people. Wearing simple face coverings is not about protecting ourselves, it is about protecting everyone we encounter.
1276945861499633665 2020-06-27 14:29:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI: I joined the @GuyBensonShow to discuss Senate Democrats’ blocking police reform and the Senate’s historic judicial confirmations.  https://t.co/bsFztYtJng
1276604940451024899 2020-06-26 15:55:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN: I’m joining @GuyBensonShow at 4:00pm ET to discuss Senate Democrats’ obstruction of police reform and our latest milestone in renewing the judiciary.   https://t.co/lCm5tWLItJ
1275836125882523648 2020-06-24 13:00:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats say they disagree with parts of @SenatorTimScott’s bill. Fine. The Senate has a way to settle policy differences. It’s called legislating. The only reason to duck the whole process is if Democrats would rather preserve a campaign issue than find a bipartisan solution.
1275836085596295168 2020-06-24 13:00:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats just blocked the Senate from even considering police reform. They threatened to do this unless I let them short-circuit the amendment process and rewrite @SenatorTimScott’s bill behind closed doors. This issue deserved better than more do-nothing Democratic theatrics.
1275826832408031233 2020-06-24 12:23:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate has confirmed 200 of President Trump’s nominees to lifetime appointments on the federal bench. With today's confirmation, not a single circuit court vacancy exists anywhere in the nation for the first time in at least 40 years.  https://t.co/BvIEuJ62l7
1275521553787215872 2020-06-23 16:10:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> “Equal protection of the laws” means that mayors and governors cannot selectively stand down because they fear the political price for confronting a particular mob.  Maintaining the peace is these leaders’ duty. It is not an option that depends on the lawbreakers’ politics.  https://t.co/o37g7EcXkf
1275470638552100864 2020-06-23 12:47:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> If the far left cannot distinguish between Confederate generals and Washington, Jefferson, and Grant, they have completely exited the real world.   We are so proud of the imperfect American heroes who built the most perfect union the world has ever seen.  https://t.co/0UdsOxz5W2
1275154926289723395 2020-06-22 15:53:20 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Later this week, thanks to @SenatorTimScott, the Senate will vote to consider police reform legislation on the floor. I hope both sides come together and vote to begin this important debate. The American people deserve more than political posturing. They deserve an outcome.
1274731458352099328 2020-06-21 11:50:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Thinking of my dad today. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads in Kentucky and across our great country.  https://t.co/fBxq8H6eDn
1274050870485962752 2020-06-19 14:46:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I just spoke in Kentucky about Juneteenth and America’s continued work to overcome the stain of our original sin. We must keep working to ensure that the timeless principles of our founding continue to triumph over prejudice and injustice.
1273682430797414401 2020-06-18 14:22:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate just confirmed @POTUS's exceptional choice to sit on the second-most-important federal bench. We Kentuckians are sorry to lose Judge Justin Walker, but we're very proud this brilliant and fair jurist will be serving our nation on the D.C. Circuit.  https://t.co/BBv87PZDgI
1273626830600355848 2020-06-18 10:41:13 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The JUSTICE Act provides solutions on police reform that are sober, serious, and significant. The Senate should address this issue now. But we’ll only be able to act if both sides can work together. I hope our Democratic colleagues will come to the table next week.
1273336356715073537 2020-06-17 15:26:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Sadly, Democrats began attacking the JUSTICE Act proposal before it was even released.   The Senate has recently put division aside to produce major bipartisan bills like the CARES Act and the Great American Outdoors Act. Police reform needs that same spirit. I hope we see it.
1273283197753843712 2020-06-17 11:55:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> .@SenatorTimScott has put together a strong and significant proposal to increase transparency, grow accountability, and advance needed reforms in policing. The Senate will turn to the JUSTICE Act next week. It will take bipartisan cooperation for the Senate to make a law.
1273283161984839681 2020-06-17 11:55:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> When Black Americans tell us they do not feel safe in their own communities, we need to listen. When citizens lack faith in our justice system, we need to respond. And when the equal protection of the law feels to some Americans like a contingency of demographics, we need to act.
1273080578682892291 2020-06-16 22:30:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Elaine and I are stunned and heartbroken by Carol Barr’s passing. Her warmth filled whatever room she entered. Her contributions made Kentucky a better place for all of us. We send our sincere condolences to Andy, their girls, and their family at this terribly painful time.
1272904643207626759 2020-06-16 10:51:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> With our country facing a pandemic, an historic economic disruption, and a major discussion of racial justice, Speaker Pelosi has mostly kept her chamber on the longest-running spring break in human history. Over here, in the Senate, we are attending to the needs of the nation.  https://t.co/90RIZ39HEc
1272621310812860418 2020-06-15 16:05:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Public lands preserve our nation’s beauty, provide recreation for American families, and help their local economies prosper. I am proud the Senate is going to pass historic legislation this week to make sure our National Parks and other lands have the permanent support they need.  https://t.co/r3dN3lYMN0
1271121269539430405 2020-06-11 12:45:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The landmark Great American Outdoors Act will help Kentuckians preserve our public lands and ensure that outdoor recreation can continue adding billions of dollars of prosperity to our state every year. I am proud we’re on track to deliver this big win for the Bluegrass.  https://t.co/r53JHXjVK3
1270760821560393734 2020-06-10 12:52:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our republic can survive a pandemic. It can survive civil unrest. But ideas and deliberation are our foundation. America cannot be America if civil disagreement becomes a contradiction in terms. Anti-speech silencing tactics are a cancer in a free and open society.
1270740679149391872 2020-06-10 11:32:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The liberal tradition in this country used to pride itself on broad-mindedness. But we have spent years watching elite institutions exchange debate and rigor for uniformity and psychological comfort. We saw it with universities. Now the free press is repeating that error.
1270402976218255368 2020-06-09 13:10:47 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The American people’s response to COVID-19 has been brave and patriotic. For months, citizens have sacrificed an enormous amount to protect their neighbors and our medical system. Their trust cannot be repaid with constitutionally dubious double standards.
1270402937475551232 2020-06-09 13:10:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Speech, assembly, and the free exercise of religion are all sacrosanct liberties. Mayors cannot play "red-light, green-light" with the First Amendment and cheer certain protests while selectively disadvantaging people of faith. The Bill of Rights is not an a-la-carte menu.
1270402851492200449 2020-06-09 13:10:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I strongly &amp; fully support Americans' right to peacefully protest. But through no fault of the demonstrators, recent days have revealed glaring inconsistencies from some local leaders. While some mayors cheer mass protests, they continue to ban careful church gatherings.  https://t.co/zkYCZcMgtw
1270137943089446914 2020-06-08 19:37:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Abolishing police would only take us farther away from the safety, justice, and equal protection of the laws that every single American deserves.  Minneapolis cannot really think that arts programs and social workers can make law enforcement obsolete.  My remarks:  https://t.co/pn4X751Z5x
1270104369099390982 2020-06-08 17:24:13 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Every year, millions of Americans turn to National Parks sites, National Wildlife Refuges, &amp; millions of acres of public lands for recreation or their livelihoods. Legislation from @SteveDaines &amp; @SenCoryGardner will secure them for generations to come.  https://t.co/Eyqc0MXL4V
1268996487750586368 2020-06-05 16:01:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today, President Trump signed new legislation that will make the PPP even stronger. In addition to @SenatorCollins and @MarcoRubio, @SteveDaines, @SenCoryGardner, and @SenThomTillis have been instrumental in keeping this lifeline for Main Street up and running.
1268996486878187522 2020-06-05 16:01:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Because of the Paycheck Protection Program from @SenatorCollins &amp; @MarcoRubio, tens of millions of Americans have kept receiving paychecks instead of pink slips during this emergency, and millions of small businesses have lived to see the reopening.
1268996485930246144 2020-06-05 16:01:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This crisis is not over. Our economic comeback is just beginning. But even in these early days of our careful reopening, the American people are already trouncing expert predictions and starting to come back strong. My full statement:  https://t.co/ECDItd5WaH
1268641704493690880 2020-06-04 16:32:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Chinese Communist Party has cheated on trade, stolen foreign technology, executed long-term plans to target the industrial bases of the United States and our allies, and weaponized foreign aid to manipulate developing countries. And continued to repress their own people.
1268641648357134348 2020-06-04 16:31:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Thirty-one years ago, brave Chinese people flooded Tiananmen Square because they hoped a more modern and prosperous China would also become more free. What they got was a massacre of hundreds if not thousands and a society that still cannot even speak about it 31 years later.
1268557969102438401 2020-06-04 10:59:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am glad President Trump has assembled such an impressive team that is working hard for all Americans. (3/3)
1268557967651192838 2020-06-04 10:59:22 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I appreciate their dedicated work at this difficult time for our nation and their steadfast commitment to their constitutional duties to preserve peace and order, uphold liberty, and protect the American people so they can freely exercise their rights. (2/3)
1268557966199980036 2020-06-04 10:59:22 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In these challenging times, the President and the American people are very well-served by the expert advice and principled leadership of people like Secretary Esper and Attorney General Barr. (1/3)
1267901690621186053 2020-06-02 15:31:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our nation is united in horror and opposition to the violent killing of Mr. Floyd. It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities. We need to unite against these violent riots.  https://t.co/H0TraEwcWp
1267846302341234693 2020-06-02 11:51:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Every one of us has an obligation to distinguish peaceful protests over the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery from the violent riots that continue to see innocent people hurt, businesses and neighborhoods destroyed, &amp; law enforcement officers assaulted.
1267632004067139584 2020-06-01 21:39:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> State and local leaders must quickly disrupt outside agitators, restore order, and protect citizens. If they can't or won't, I hope the federal government is ready to stand in the breach.   There is no constitutional right to commit violent crime or terrorize communities. Period.  https://t.co/HAdTXpvz57
1267613542775128067 2020-06-01 20:26:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Americans have watched peaceful protests hijacked into violent riots that inflict the kind of injustice they supposedly oppose. Small businesses destroyed. Neighborhoods torn up. Police attacked on city streets.   These riots need to stop. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Now.  https://t.co/bhvWyBoW7a
1267593806477697031 2020-06-01 19:08:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I have fought for civil rights and the First Amendment. I completely support Americans’ rights to peaceably protest and be heard. Our nation cannot deafen itself to the anger, pain, or frustration of black Americans. Our nation needs to hear this.  https://t.co/x1eraRv7WD
1267582495547109377 2020-06-01 18:23:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> But here’s something that requires no investigation: In no world can arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on the man’s neck for nine minutes while he cries out “I can’t breathe” and then goes silent.  https://t.co/sXla0dQbKk
1267572400666939392 2020-06-01 17:43:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This is an hour of great pain for our nation. Americans everywhere have been grieved and horrified by the killings of African-American citizens. We need the facts, we need the truth, and we need accountability. We need swift justice under law.  https://t.co/mRuccN5x7V
1266412409947934721 2020-05-29 12:53:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our city, our state, and our country have to pull together. My full statement on the protests and riots in Louisville and across the country:  https://t.co/rFOyjC3AHf
1266035007312875520 2020-05-28 11:54:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our country is starting to carefully re-open. Any further legislation will need to focus on practical solutions that help kids return to school next fall, help laid-off Americans get re-hired, and stop frivolous lawsuits from stalling our recovery.  https://t.co/pQWG5FTc3y
1265669804536598529 2020-05-27 11:42:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> From the heroic health professionals at @UK_HealthCare to the James B. Beam Institute for Kentucky Spirits making hand sanitizer, the @UniversityofKY has stepped up big-time for the Bluegrass. I was proud to lead the Senate’s action to help make their work possible.  https://t.co/dHGFxYxNaA
1265453385999962117 2020-05-26 21:22:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today I had the honor to thank some of Kentucky’s front-line healthcare professionals. When our nation comes through this pandemic, it will be because American heroes like these won this fight.  https://t.co/xudk38p2vf
1265292459178733568 2020-05-26 10:43:24 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The CARES Act is investing billions of dollars into families, healthcare workers, and small businesses across the country. In Kentucky, it’s already added up to an $11 billion impact.  https://t.co/LWE2gij9B5
1264889500746108930 2020-05-25 08:02:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> As we continue to meet a new generation of American heroes, we set Memorial Day aside to honor the memory of brave men and women who have laid down their lives in military service. May our actions pay tribute to their tremendous sacrifice for our great nation.  https://t.co/BQkKdfrRgZ
1263938348772724736 2020-05-22 17:02:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats are playing with perpetual impeachment while the Senate fights the pandemic. Speaker Pelosi is in no position to be lecturing us about what the appropriate use of Senate time is. The American people deserve answers and we intend to get them.  https://t.co/7oXcXc7LLx
1263904763302813696 2020-05-22 14:49:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> All month, the Senate has been on the job, attending to the needs of our nation. The real contrast is with the House. Two days they've been in session in the last eight weeks. At this point, I’m wondering if we should send Senators over there to collect their newspapers.  https://t.co/MQYTlMgFXX
1263877412657532932 2020-05-22 13:00:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We need to work smart here. Help the people who are desperately in need, try to save as many jobs as possible, begin to open up the states, and get this economy growing again.  https://t.co/8KvfUs4LLW
1263604320848748546 2020-05-21 18:55:21 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN 📺: I will be joining @marthamaccallum ~7:00 PM EST to discuss the House Democrats’ obsession with impeachment and the Senate’s continued focus on coronavirus relief, legal protections for frontline workers, and other key Senate priorities.  https://t.co/ylbrcuMJHW
1263531446347730945 2020-05-21 14:05:46 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> These past few months have been terrible and trying for our country. But in the midst of this tragedy, our country is pulling together. I’m proud of the ways my fellow Kentuckians are showing us how it’s done.  https://t.co/pcSSrxHi7Z
1263491637122142208 2020-05-21 11:27:35 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats have been missing in action for months. They just forced through a remote voting scheme so they can continue their absence. But there’s a problem: Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution.  https://t.co/o3NYQJsprz
1263221193655623681 2020-05-20 17:32:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> My hometown of Louisville, Kentucky is home to the baseball bat factory that makes the world-famous Louisville Slugger. Thanks to the Paycheck Protection Program, 171 employees were pulled off furlough and put right back on the payroll.  https://t.co/rvawNGCAMp
1263181545143250944 2020-05-20 14:55:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> You can’t make this up: During a global crisis, House Democrats are arguing that the acquittal of President Trump did not actually end their impeachment. They would rather spend another year trying to cram politics into the legal system than help the Senate govern the country.  https://t.co/X1GU2sNWAM
1263145874206724100 2020-05-20 12:33:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate is working for the American people during this crisis. We’ve been in session for weeks. House Democrats have shown up for work two days in eight weeks. They flew into town to pass a far-left wish list that could not even unite their own conference &amp; promptly left town.  https://t.co/XaUzFgD1Al
1262865723795308552 2020-05-19 18:00:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate passed FISA reforms last week. We'll soon confirm a new Director of National Intelligence. And led by @LindseyGrahamSC, we’re moving to subpoena people like James Comey and Loretta Lynch to get to the bottom of the 2016 abuses. The American people deserve the truth.  https://t.co/qV2ASwphHE
1262845302681280512 2020-05-19 16:39:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats spent years hyping the Russian collusion conspiracy theory. That collapsed upon investigation. Here’s what the facts did turn up: A stunning pattern of incompetence, outright bias, or both that brought federal law enforcement into the 2016 campaign.  https://t.co/Cb8zetSyT0
1262478323604733953 2020-05-18 16:21:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am glad to announce that Senator @MarcoRubio has accepted my invitation to serve as Acting Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. My full statement:  https://t.co/NcnLB0KcBk
1262472413561917447 2020-05-18 15:57:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> A new generation of American heroes has been called to serve their neighbors and their nation. They are showing up for our country. So the Senate is showing up for them.  https://t.co/DmrJp0dBLK
1261404120952365057 2020-05-15 17:12:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The House has been at home for two months. They gave themselves no assignments except developing this proposal. Yet it still reads like the Speaker of the House pasted together random ideas from her most liberal members and slapped the word “coronavirus” on top of it.  https://t.co/pS0EwP5wo5
1261385930180489217 2020-05-15 16:00:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This week Speaker Pelosi published an 1,800-page catalog of left-wing oddities &amp; called it a coronavirus relief bill. It proposes tax hikes on small business, giveaways to blue-state millionaires, checks for illegal immigrants, and diversity detectives for the cannabis industry.  https://t.co/deEIYPEMSg
1261371804133646337 2020-05-15 15:04:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Forget about this $3 trillion left-wing wish list that even House Democrats are criticizing. Republicans are focused on practical solutions like legal liability protections for medical workers and the schools, universities, and businesses that will be trying to re-open.  https://t.co/tSRbJMeilh
1261361186148319232 2020-05-15 14:21:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> 80,000 Americans have died. More than 20 million have lost their jobs. Most people call that a crisis. But leading Democrats call it “leverage.”   A co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus: “For me, the leverage is that there is enormous suffering.”  https://t.co/b0mEyqCePA
1261344517808099328 2020-05-15 13:15:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Democrats’ supposed coronavirus bill includes taxpayer-funded studies to measure “diversity and inclusion” in the cannabis industry. It’s a parade of absurdities that can hardly be taken seriously.  https://t.co/2aCyOEnnAZ
1261317327766917120 2020-05-15 11:27:39 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Washington Democrats have been transparent: They see this national tragedy as a ripe partisan opportunity to pass long-standing wish-list items that are completely unrelated to the crisis itself.  https://t.co/T5EDTfEBHS
1261291104336560129 2020-05-15 09:43:27 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The coronavirus pandemic is a serious crisis, so the Senate’s response has been serious. The Senate took a blank sheet of paper, turned it into the largest rescue package in history, and passed it unanimously.  https://t.co/caEY934GO3
1261054358571159553 2020-05-14 18:02:42 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN 📺: I will be joining @BretBaier ~6:15 PM EST to discuss House Democrats’ unserious $3 trillion wish list and what the Senate is doing to attack this crisis and lead the response.  https://t.co/3IIvjOOnN9
1260949852302839810 2020-05-14 11:07:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate will keep working seriously on this serious pandemic. We wrote the CARES Act. Now we’re back in Washington. We’re holding hearings with experts about the re-opening. We’re monitoring testing. We’re drafting legal protections for healthcare workers and small businesses.
1260949850889355264 2020-05-14 11:07:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats had a blank slate to propose any vision for the recovery. This draft is all they have done for two months. And they came up with: tax hikes on small businesses, tax cuts for blue-state millionaires, and taxpayer-funded diversity detectives for the pot industry.
1260949849727516673 2020-05-14 11:07:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats’ huge new bill would cut taxes for blue-state millionaires, send government checks to illegal immigrants, and — wait for it — mandate two separate taxpayer-funded studies of diversity in the cannabis industry. This is their effort at coronavirus relief?
1260560488439648258 2020-05-13 09:20:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Paycheck Protection Program is continuing to provide critical relief for small businesses across America. The manufacturer of Louisville Slugger bats says it put 171 furloughed employees back on the payroll after receiving a loan.  https://t.co/dz2OMhK6eY
1260289048817606656 2020-05-12 15:21:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans are preparing a major package of COVID-related liability reforms to foster economic recovery. We are going to provide certainty. If we want American workers to clock back in, we need employers to know they will not be left to drown in opportunistic litigation.
1260289047274143744 2020-05-12 15:21:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> More than two-thirds of independent business owners say they are worried about a legal liability minefield getting in the way of re-opening. The Senate majority is not going to stand idly by and let trial lawyers vacuum up relief money &amp; redirect it into their own pockets.
1259951368510541830 2020-05-11 16:59:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> During the pandemic, our nation continues to meet new American heroes &amp; draw inspiration from their stories. Today I introduced the country to another incredible Kentuckian: A 30-year veteran nurse who contracted the virus, beat it, &amp; then went back to caring for patients.  https://t.co/w3cBy1hFf0
1259897376438980615 2020-05-11 13:25:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Paycheck Protection Program is helping nearly 42,000 Kentucky job creators &amp; millions of small businesses nationwide access emergency cash. This program is a lifeline for American workers and Main Streets across the country.  https://t.co/932RztspXA
1259454453809393664 2020-05-10 08:05:15 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Thinking of my mom Julia today. Happy Mother’s Day to all the moms in Kentucky and across our great country.  https://t.co/MMEcbBIsLv
1258872550194585602 2020-05-08 17:32:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today was also meant to be the dedication for the Eisenhower Memorial. But as in Ike’s time, a monumental challenge has intervened — one that demands American strength and leadership to resolve. Thank you to @SenPatRoberts for your work in making this fitting memorial a reality.
1258872548718149633 2020-05-08 17:32:58 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today marks 75 years since V-E Day, the end of WWII in Europe. As Americans work together to emerge from a global crisis, we’re reminded of the essential role our nation played in leading the world out of another.
1258547351746158595 2020-05-07 20:00:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Strong legal protections will be essential as our economy reopens. As of a week ago, 771 lawsuits had already been filed against everyone from workers on the front lines to universities to businesses. Our rescue efforts cannot get diverted into a huge giveaway for trial lawyers.  https://t.co/Q4rpyPpshM
1258506186472607744 2020-05-07 17:17:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Chinese Communist Party even used the pandemic as cover to arrest peaceful Hong Kong democracy activists, including my old friend Martin Lee. I suppose they thought the rest of the world might be too distracted to notice. They were mistaken.
1258473727844659208 2020-05-07 15:08:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our National Day of Prayer certainly comes at the right time this year. Let’s pray for everyone who is sick and suffering with the coronavirus, struggling with unemployment and isolation, or working on the front lines to care for strangers and keep our nation going.  https://t.co/gc7hmw095G
1258454574333075460 2020-05-07 13:52:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN 📺: I will be joining @DanaPerino ~2:00 PM EST to discuss the Senate's role in continuing to strengthen our health response, pivoting towards recovery, and other crucial legislation.
1258443524871278593 2020-05-07 13:08:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This pandemic originated in China. Its global spread was made worse by China’s unconscionable efforts to cover it up. Working closely with our allies and partners around the world, the U.S. will be asking tough questions about our relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.
1258402404858335232 2020-05-07 10:24:47 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> While we fight COVID-19, we can’t forget all the other threats we still face. Terrorist cells, hostile foreign intelligence services, and adversaries all over the world who would be thrilled if the U.S. applies social distancing to our presence on the world stage as well.
1258141271496982528 2020-05-06 17:07:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Every day, I hear more inspiring stories from my home state about Kentuckians finding creative ways to pitch in. This crisis is creating new heroes in new ways every day. I could not be prouder to represent the Bluegrass and bring #Kentucky’s voice to the Senate.  https://t.co/h72zoCLvWZ
1258082641615769600 2020-05-06 13:14:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Judge Justin Walker is a brilliant legal expert whose record earns praise all across the political spectrum. He is so qualified and fair-minded that he's even won the blessing of the left-leaning American Bar Association that Democrats themselves call “the gold standard.”  https://t.co/KQIIG68TdE
1258072736540307456 2020-05-06 12:34:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate is not going to let either the coronavirus or reflexive partisanship stop us from doing crucial national business. We are elected to do our jobs. I’m glad we’ll have a Senate-confirmed counterintelligence leader by the end of the day.
1258072733637902336 2020-05-06 12:34:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Even though the Democrats’ own top member on the Intelligence Committee praises this nominee and wants a swift confirmation, Senate Democrats still forced us to use hours of floor time and multiple votes, as if he were controversial. This is what I've called mindless obstruction.
1258072732794851332 2020-05-06 12:34:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today the Senate will confirm a Director for the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. Our domestic fight with the coronavirus makes it even more important, not less important, that we also maintain global vigilance and keep a close eye on those who wish us harm.
1258035512717316097 2020-05-06 10:06:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Nurses in #Kentucky and across America are rushing toward the sick, washing their hands until they bleed, and working around the clock to heal strangers and fight the coronavirus. Today and every day, we salute you.  https://t.co/7MPPc8FW78
1257745933934235650 2020-05-05 14:56:13 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Teachers in #Kentucky and across America are adapting to online learning and continuing to educate young minds. They are among the many heroes during this crisis. The entire Senate salutes and thanks all of our nation’s educators on this National Teacher Day.  https://t.co/JPRAO8LY9O
1257413501330632709 2020-05-04 16:55:14 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I want to thank the staff who worked hard to support the Senate’s remote work and the experts who are helping us safely and smartly resume some in-person operations today. Neither the virus nor our nation’s adversaries take days off, and thanks to you, neither does the Senate.
1257394415351541760 2020-05-04 15:39:24 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate is back in session because we have critically important work to do for the nation. Our bosses are the American people and they are counting on us to keep serving.
1256324376812613633 2020-05-01 16:47:27 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> All across America, essential workers are following expert advice and taking new precautions while they continue reporting for duty. Starting Monday, the Senate will do the same. We will continue to stand together for the American people — even as we stand six feet apart.  https://t.co/V44KNzrgRf
1256324369866846208 2020-05-01 16:47:25 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am grateful to all the dedicated professionals who have worked to develop solutions so the Senate can smartly and safely begin resuming our critical in-person work on Monday. I strongly urge my colleagues to consult these guidelines.  https://t.co/EQxAqhfkZq
1255624621518458883 2020-04-29 18:26:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI 🎙️: I joined @kilmeade to discuss liability protections for frontline workers, reconvening the Senate next week, and Senate Republicans’ accomplishments working with President Trump:  https://t.co/EXNsOtaE3l
1255518614058422273 2020-04-29 11:25:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We need to provide protection – litigation protection – for those who have been on the front lines. And we have to help businesses and employees go back to work without fear of trial lawyers sharpening their pencils.  https://t.co/CjbrD6dP9o
1255234613024362500 2020-04-28 16:37:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN 📺: I will be joining Neil Cavuto on @FoxNews ~4:45 PM EST to discuss the Senate agenda.
1255166067892195328 2020-04-28 12:04:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI️: I joined the @GuyBensonShow to discuss the Senate reconvening on May 4th, keeping our focus on COVID-19 relief, and legal protections for health care workers.  https://t.co/DuDORUBNYK
1254855764721557504 2020-04-27 15:31:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN: I will be joining the @GuyBensonShow  at ~3:30 PM ET to discuss the Senate reconvening and Senate Republicans' plan to strengthen our response to the coronavirus crisis.  https://t.co/HC2JtVG5S1
1254830745639686144 2020-04-27 13:52:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate must focus on concrete steps to strengthen our response to this crisis. The American people do not need tangential left-wing daydreams. They need commonsense steps that move us toward the response, recovery, and future readiness that Americans need.  https://t.co/p1hgFAjUBm
1254830739939643397 2020-04-27 13:52:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> If it is essential for doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, truck drivers, grocery-store workers, and other brave Americans to keep carefully manning their duty stations, then it is essential for Senators to carefully man ours and support them. We are reconvening next week.  https://t.co/XNmJGkGjcW
1254139921209659393 2020-04-25 16:07:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Thanks to the Paycheck Protection Program, more businesses like The Cheddar Box Cafe in Kentucky, will be able to keep their doors open and their employees on payroll. This is just one of the many success stories of this vital  job saving program.  https://t.co/cQlSVJBDVJ
1253723498796679172 2020-04-24 12:32:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This new bill strengthens some of the most important parts of the CARES Act, especially the popular Paycheck Protection Program which is saving millions of American jobs as we speak. And Republicans successfully kept extraneous issues out of the bill. It’s a win for the country.
1253723498087940099 2020-04-24 12:32:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate's historic CARES Act is the largest rescue package in American history. It is already sending hundreds of billions of dollars to struggling small businesses, hard-hit hospitals, testing, very targeted COVID-19 help for states and localities, and direct aid to families.
1253723497274187777 2020-04-24 12:32:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> .@POTUS just signed our latest relief bill. It expands funding for saving small businesses and protecting Americans’ paychecks. It strengthens support for hospitals, healthcare providers, and testing. Proud to have led the historic CARES Act and this expansion of key provisions.
1253351930744705026 2020-04-23 11:56:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Historic, tragic layoffs continue to pile up nationwide. This pandemic has erased a decade of job creation in just over one month.   Democrats should never have made the Paycheck Protection Program lapse. The House must follow the Senate’s lead and vote today to re-open it.
1253113490606370818 2020-04-22 20:08:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI 📺: I joined @FoxNews with @BillHemmer to discuss yesterday’s Senate vote to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program and the next steps to help our nation combat the pandemic.  https://t.co/Lhvw4MEwsL
1253038164400394240 2020-04-22 15:09:13 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN 📺 to @FoxNews. I will be joining @BillHemmer soon to discuss Senate Republicans’ successful effort to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program.
1252999001131102209 2020-04-22 12:33:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI🎙️: I joined @hughhewitt to discuss Senate Republican's victory yesterday on more legislation to help American workers through the pandemic and the Senate’s continued focus on confirming impressive new judges.  https://t.co/hmQsATvFJJ
1252738721062977540 2020-04-21 19:19:20 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Martin Lee is an old friend of mine. He’s a brave and steady voice for the freedom and autonomy of Hong Kong. The authorities just had him arrested. His new op-ed is essential reading:  https://t.co/aJDY7U1Xx0
1252704848497315840 2020-04-21 17:04:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’m proud of Congress’s new bipartisan agreement. I am just sorry that Democrats shut down emergency support for Main Street in a search for partisan “leverage” that never materialized.   It’s time to move forward together and get this done for the American people.  https://t.co/cUkQU0MT9P
1252676152864526337 2020-04-21 15:10:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am encouraged that Democrats have finally agreed to reopen the Paycheck Protection Program and abandon a number of their unrelated demands. My full statement on Congress’s new bipartisan agreement to provide additional small-business support, more funding for testing, and more:  https://t.co/nDnhxbs9KB
1252301158632357888 2020-04-20 14:20:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It’s been four days since the Paycheck Protection Program ran dry. Republicans have been trying to fund this job-saving program for over a week, but Democrats have blocked us. The Senate will meet again tomorrow. I hope my colleagues will finally let this help move forward.
1251584555183726592 2020-04-18 14:53:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> These outrageous arrests are just one more example of Beijing’s shameful efforts to strangle the freedom and autonomy of Hong Kongers. I wrote about these coordinated efforts last year:  https://t.co/vpCKX4EpAA
1251583670818832384 2020-04-18 14:49:35 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Chinese Communist Party should not be allowed to use a pandemic — which they exacerbated through secrecy and inaction — as cover for its agents to arrest peaceful pro-democracy leaders. We stand with Hong Kong.  https://t.co/RpAsZ5hZvJ
1251550591643508738 2020-04-18 12:38:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Paycheck Protection Program ran dry on Thursday and Democrats continue to block more funding. Democrats must let us reopen this crucial program before more Americans are laid off needlessly and more small businesses are shuttered that could have survived.
1251246681783402498 2020-04-17 16:30:30 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Chairman @MikeCrapo will coordinate Senate-wide oversight of the historic CARES Act, and I am appointing @SenToomey to the five-member Congressional Oversight Commission. I am grateful that these expert leaders are stepping up.  https://t.co/zOW2JvNR3r
1251169088208097280 2020-04-17 11:22:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Twenty million Americans have lost their jobs in one month. We badly need the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program to keep saving more small businesses. But Democrats have been blocking its funding for over a week and now this crucial program is shut down.  https://t.co/uSGOuup5bJ
1250901684349546496 2020-04-16 17:39:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Five million more Americans lost their jobs just last week.  That makes 20 million layoffs in one month.   Americans need Democrats to stop blocking emergency paycheck money and let this job-saving program reopen.  I hope our colleagues come around soon.  https://t.co/1IFNChRw4D
1250886374577881088 2020-04-16 16:38:46 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Even now, Senate Democrats are still blocking funding for the Paycheck Protection Program.    It is surreal to see Democratic leaders treat support for workers and small businesses as something they need to be goaded into supporting.  https://t.co/jcgc9wxIKl
1250868615013904385 2020-04-16 15:28:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> One week ago, I warned that the Paycheck Protection Program was running out of money and tried to a pass clean funding bill. Senate Democrats blocked it.  Here we are, a week later, with no progress. This morning, the PPP ran out of money and shut down, just as we’d warned.  https://t.co/L8EGPHMfrn
1250802661890367497 2020-04-16 11:06:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Republicans tried to pass more money for Americans’ paychecks last week. Democrats blocked it. Speaker Pelosi said she saw “no data as to why we need it." She said "we have time to negotiate.”   Democrats did nothing and now the program has shut down.
1250784903802880000 2020-04-16 09:55:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Millions more Americans are losing their jobs every week. Absolutely crushing.   Republicans have spent a week trying to fund the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program so more Americans can keep their jobs.   Democrats are blocking the money and making the program run dry.
1250591765662498826 2020-04-15 21:08:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The cost of continued Democratic obstruction on the Paycheck Protection Program will be pink slips and shuttered businesses. Funding for a bipartisan program should not be a partisan issue. My joint statement with @GOPLeader:  https://t.co/U3xoahKTHo
1250591742212145152 2020-04-15 21:08:00 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Paycheck Protection Program will run out of money in a matter of hours. It has been stunning to watch our Democratic colleagues treat emergency funding for Americans’ paychecks like a Republican priority which they need to be goaded into supporting.  https://t.co/U3xoahKTHo
1250466103488393217 2020-04-15 12:48:46 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI🎤: I joined @FRCdc Washington Watch with Tony Perkins to discuss our work on the coronavirus crisis and the importance of an independent judiciary to protecting our Constitution.  https://t.co/Y8jidl9iik
1250166157014859777 2020-04-14 16:56:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> TUNE IN🎤: I will be speaking to @FRCdc Washington Watch with Tony Perkins at ~5:00 pm to discuss the coronavirus crisis and Judge Walker's ruling defending Kentuckians’ religious liberty.  https://t.co/hvGhlPbUch
1250111824575500288 2020-04-14 13:20:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Clean funding for worker pay in a crisis should not be controversial. I hope our Democratic colleagues will let Congress act this week. American workers deserve paychecks, not pink slips caused by political games.  https://t.co/sSOr4atjw8
1249763486156173313 2020-04-13 14:16:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Last week, Democrats objected to a clean funding increase for the crucial Paycheck Protection Program – even though it’s on track to run out of funding as soon as this week.   American workers deserve better than political games.
1249294094163197953 2020-04-12 07:11:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today, even at a distance, Christians are united by the triumph of the Resurrection. I wish my fellow Kentuckians and all who celebrate a very happy and blessed Easter.
1249111736122146818 2020-04-11 19:06:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Exactly. Elaine and I will be celebrating Easter at home. I encourage all Kentuckians to do likewise and to follow all CDC guidance. But governments need to protect citizens’ health without trampling basic constitutional principles at the same time.
1249058586761846786 2020-04-11 15:35:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Grateful for this strong, eloquent ruling defending Kentuckians’ religious liberty from Judge Justin Walker, @POTUS’s outstanding nominee for the D.C. Circuit. Of course church parking lots cannot be singled out with unfair standards that differ from other establishments.
1248960721825775621 2020-04-11 09:06:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I issued the following statement with @GOPLeader on the urgent need to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program. There is no excuse for a lack of urgency. American jobs are literally at stake.  https://t.co/3cDTkK8mQ9
1248660227018424321 2020-04-10 13:12:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Small business layoffs spiked 1,000% last month. 10% of the U.S. workforce is now jobless. This is no time for political games.  I hope Democrats stop blocking more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program very soon. American jobs depend on it.  https://t.co/R1TGM8gc84
1248383474941095936 2020-04-09 18:53:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Thanks to the CARES Act, healthcare providers that participate in the Medicare program will receive a direct deposit in their bank accounts from @HHSGov. In Kentucky and across America, we must keep our hospitals and their brave workers equipped for success.
1248267476032466947 2020-04-09 11:12:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We just found out that 16 million Americans have been laid off in three weeks. A staggering 10% of the labor force is now out of work. This is a crisis. No time for partisan maneuvering or politics as usual. I hope Democrats reverse course &amp; let us increase paycheck support soon.
1248267381182550017 2020-04-09 11:11:50 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Democrats just blocked urgent money for a popular, bipartisan job-saving program which they themselves literally coauthored with us two weeks ago. I complimented both sides and asked to increase the dollar amount without changing anything else. But they blocked it.
1248042215676563462 2020-04-08 20:17:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I hope none of my colleagues object to my request for these urgently-needed funds. There is no reason why this bipartisan job-saving program should be held hostage for other priorities. Let's re-fund the only program that's already running dry and keep moving forward together.
1248042214984466433 2020-04-08 20:17:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Ten million Americans were laid off in just the last two weeks. Tomorrow morning will likely bring another historic unemployment figure. This is urgent. If Senators delay this urgent paycheck support to insist on a broader bill, more Americans will lose their jobs unnecessarily.
1248042214263054342 2020-04-08 20:17:06 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> If we want to act fast, Congress has to focus. There is no realistic chance that another sprawling bill which allocates half a trillion dollars to a number of priorities, even important ones, will be able to pass the Senate or the House by unanimous consent this week.
1248042213533265931 2020-04-08 20:17:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Nobody thinks tomorrow will be the Senate’s last word on COVID-19. Other crucial parts of the CARES Act, like its historic funds for hospitals and healthcare providers, are still coming online and have not yet been exhausted. The PPP is where the lights are already flashing red.
1248042212753104896 2020-04-08 20:17:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tomorrow morning, I’ll ask unanimous consent to pass standalone emergency funding for the hugely popular Paycheck Protection Program that is saving small-business jobs as we speak. As the rest of the CARES Act continues to come online, this key part is already low on funds.
1247987000105451521 2020-04-08 16:37:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Restaurant Workers Relief Program was created to serve fellow Kentuckians in Louisville. Now, it’s expanding to serve more than 50,000 hot meals to service industry workers and their families across the country.  https://t.co/mMdRxH4JyK
1247934101941878784 2020-04-08 13:07:30 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> God’s Pantry has been busy during the coronavirus pandemic, and the @kentuckyguard has been there to help, packing 10k boxes of food for those in need across the Commonwealth. Thank you to our Kentucky Guard for showing that we’re all in this together.  https://t.co/451WtYeFQD
1247551023922675712 2020-04-07 11:45:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I will work with Secretary Mnuchin and Leader Schumer and hope to approve further funding for the Paycheck Protection Program by unanimous consent or voice vote during the next scheduled Senate session on Thursday.  https://t.co/idRXGn22xq
1247550719781109760 2020-04-07 11:44:04 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Even as the CARES Act continues to come online, it is clear that the small-business Paycheck Protection Program will need more funding. Congress needs to act with speed and focus to provide more money for this crucial and bipartisan program.  https://t.co/idRXGn22xq
1247244542170054657 2020-04-06 15:27:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> More inspiring examples of Kentuckians helping Kentuckians: Colleges and universities across the Commonwealth are stepping up to make and donate protective equipment for front line health care workers.  https://t.co/v158YFNFr7
1247208728861999104 2020-04-06 13:05:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Federal, state, and local officials in Kentucky are working overtime together to assist those in need. And citizens across the Commonwealth are stepping up and finding creative ways to pitch in and help others.  United we stand, divided we fall.  https://t.co/Y9V0aFPW86
1246190527453806595 2020-04-03 17:39:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The most important thing that we can do for our nation’s small businesses &amp; their employees is to provide them resources to weather this storm. That’s exactly why the Senate wrote and passed the CARES Act.  https://t.co/H9Dk98ASzk  https://t.co/2Mz3RSFHdf
1246162846880354306 2020-04-03 15:49:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans are closely tracking the implementation of our historic CARES Act as the Administration puts it into effect for the American people. We are committed to supporting American workers, families, and small businesses as our nation confronts this historic emergency.
1246159275141013507 2020-04-03 15:34:58 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’m glad Speaker Pelosi is again standing down from efforts to use this crisis to push unrelated left-wing priorities. The latest proposal had been a massive tax-code giveaway for wealthy people in blue states that was instantly panned by economists across the spectrum.
1246081323489525760 2020-04-03 10:25:13 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am proud that President Trump’s search took him outside the Beltway and into the Bluegrass. Judge Walker is a brilliant and fair jurist who reveres the Constitution. He’s a leading light in a new generation of federal judges.
1246081061601370114 2020-04-03 10:24:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Judge Justin Walker, @POTUS’s choice to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, is an outstanding legal scholar. President Trump has chosen a rising Kentucky star to refresh a crucial federal court. My statement:  https://t.co/Ls6TNAQl27
1245827910331752453 2020-04-02 17:38:14 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Every American is feeling the effects of the coronavirus. It’s a national health &amp; economic emergency that demanded action. I’m proud that the biggest rescue package in history, led by Senate Republicans, will help workers &amp; families respond.  https://t.co/VCXGc2xeNG
1245778381419024385 2020-04-02 14:21:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’m grateful to Kentuckians who are stepping up to show compassion and resolve. It’s because of stories like this that we will make it through this. We are all in this together, even if we have to stand six feet apart.  https://t.co/QmOCA65Ps6
1245404302090350592 2020-04-01 13:34:58 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats are still trying to use this crisis to push unrelated pet priorities.   Last week: Carbon regulations.   Now? A tax giveaway for wealthy people in blue states, panned by economists across the spectrum.   This is a crisis. Let's act like it.  https://t.co/okeS98rSkc
1245375813551357954 2020-04-01 11:41:46 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I made sure the historic CARES Act did not leave states like Kentucky behind. I am glad the first federal funds are already starting to flow to local governments to help Kentuckians weather this health crisis and economic emergency.  https://t.co/o5DiB1URVE

1243674210712641541 2020-03-27 19:00:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It was an honor to join @POTUS at the White House today for the signing of the CARES Act.   The American people needed this rescue package. They needed it quickly. And the Senate delivered, 96-0. It's a proud moment for our country.  https://t.co/jk33y5D5lg
1243637711703019527 2020-03-27 16:35:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> .@POTUS just signed the CARES Act. The Senate's bold legislation is now law.  It will get emergency cash to families and small businesses and surge resources to doctors, nurses, hospitals, and the race for new treatments and vaccines. #WeAreAllInThisTogether
1243628065713946624 2020-03-27 15:56:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI 🎤: I joined @FocusFamily to discuss how the Senate’s historic CARES Act will put emergency cash into the hands of American families who need it the most.

1243559620880273409 2020-03-27 11:24:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI📺: Last night, I joined @marthamaccallum with @FoxNews to discuss the Senate’s historic response to the coronavirus, which will rush much needed aid to our brave medical professionals and relief to families and small businesses.  https://t.co/eN5sCeBLBU
1243032581576286208 2020-03-26 00:30:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate just pivoted from one of the most divided periods in recent memory to passing the largest rescue package in American history. And we passed it unanimously.   Americans deserved this outcome. I am proud the Senate stepped up.
1242886553988468738 2020-03-25 14:50:20 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our nation will meet a lot of new heroes — from first responders to grocery clerks to delivery drivers. Most of all, we'll meet a whole lot of heroes in scrubs working to heal the sick. When our nation comes through this, it will be because American heroes won this fight.  https://t.co/3RVAJNuLo1
1242690673800855552 2020-03-25 01:51:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> At last, we have a deal.   After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic.   We’re going to pass this legislation later today.

1242179066024857601 2020-03-23 15:59:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Every day, this economic crisis deepens and more Americans lose their jobs.   Senate Democrats are blocking emergency loans to small businesses, direct checks for Americans, and even a huge expansion of unemployment benefits during the emergency.  https://t.co/UdotiiXXcX
1242158911748268034 2020-03-23 14:38:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> These are just some of the unrelated demands Senate Democrats have used to slow relief for workers and families:   ✖️ Tax credits for solar and wind energy ✖️ Special treatment for Big Labor ✖️ Airlines' emissions standards   This is a crisis. Why is only one side acting like it?  https://t.co/MRfnXT1HJ2
1241929925923397634 2020-03-22 23:29:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our nation cannot afford this game of chicken. We cannot afford the cynical partisanship.  This is a national emergency. Not a partisan opportunity.  Doctors, nurses, small business employees, laid-off Americans, and vulnerable seniors need help right now.  https://t.co/zXPqodt8ZI
1241890195676573696 2020-03-22 20:51:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The American people expect us to act. If we fail, it will be because Senate Democrats are continuing to dither while the country expects bold, bipartisan action.  https://t.co/23pFHoDtCl
1241753730921291777 2020-03-22 11:48:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This morning I hosted a meeting with congressional leadership and Sec. Mnuchin. It is time to come together, finalize the results of our bipartisan discussions, and get the CARES Act to the President’s desk.  https://t.co/HierUIlNVC
1241538134699057157 2020-03-21 21:32:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The past two days of intense bipartisan talks are very close to a resolution. An update on the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, &amp; Economic Security Act:  https://t.co/KHB2RJhkJx
1241495687012978695 2020-03-21 18:43:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> More Americans are being laid off every day. More small businesses are being forced to shed payroll every day. Our nurses and doctors need key supplies.   Nobody should view this as political opportunity for either side. This is a national emergency.   It is time to come together
1241460610078052354 2020-03-21 16:24:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Kentucky’s state motto is “United we stand, divided we fall.” I’m inspired by all the Kentuckians who are stepping up to serve their neighbors and showing Washington how it’s done.   United we stand — even if we have to stand six feet apart for a few weeks.  https://t.co/Vsysj34wv1

1241169962183655425 2020-03-20 21:09:13 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Laid-off workers cannot wait. Struggling Main Street businesses cannot wait. Our hospitals and health centers cannot wait.   This crisis is moving fast.   The Senate is here, we are working, and we need to deliver.
1241154878753341440 2020-03-20 20:09:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans’ CARES Act would continue to push resources to the front lines of the medical battle against this virus.  https://t.co/7IXE0VYMXS
1241138905044393985 2020-03-20 19:05:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Our Senate proposal would provide the quickest possible access to desperately-needed liquidity for small businesses across our nation.   A rapid injection of cash to help small businesses survive this crisis and help workers continue to get paid.  https://t.co/R8vD1ha87A
1241123597416108032 2020-03-20 18:04:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The CARES Act would deliver direct financial help. Senate Republicans want to put cash in Americans’ hands.   No tangled Washington process. No piles of forms for laid-off workers or families to fill out.   Money for hardworking families. From the middle class on down. Period.  https://t.co/kBXeAirqxr
1241101073160581124 2020-03-20 16:35:29 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It's our job to step in and help people through this global pandemic.  https://t.co/0rs8YASQqR

1241075595188088832 2020-03-20 14:54:14 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Yesterday, I introduced the CARES Act: Senate Republicans’ bold plan to help combat the health and economic challenges of the coronavirus.

1241061388178644992 2020-03-20 13:57:47 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans and @POTUS have a common goal: to get relief to American workers, families, &amp; small businesses as rapidly as possible.   We’re going to stay at this until we can pass a bipartisan bill out of the Senate.  https://t.co/1xo81BygT7

1240754803044757505 2020-03-19 17:39:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate is not going anywhere until we act. Senate Republicans are here and ready to work with our Democratic colleagues and the Administration to get results as soon as possible.  Let’s get this done for the country.
1240754742428565507 2020-03-19 17:39:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, &amp; Economic Security Act proposes bold action on four urgent priorities:  1. Direct financial help for Americans  2. Relief for small businesses &amp; their employees 3. More stability for our economy 4. More support for patients &amp; healthcare professionals
1240746871309688834 2020-03-19 17:08:00 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Fundamentally, we have to beat back this virus.  Our proposal will go even further to remove barriers to care, speed innovation, fund the hospitals &amp; health centers that will treat patients, &amp; expand healthcare workers’ access to the tools they need, including respirator masks.  https://t.co/NFahKmmu0j

A rapid injection of cash to help small businesses through this turmoil. Let’s help small businesses and workers endure this and emerge from it ready to thrive.  https://t.co/qP3TdUBIFM
1240723320879841281 2020-03-19 15:34:25 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We know our economy won’t bounce back to normal tomorrow. An underlying medical reality is driving this disruption. This about immediately helping workers, families, small businesses, and positioning us to thrive on the other side.  America is strong and we will beat this virus.  https://t.co/XUpMCEdhGP
1240694309789130754 2020-03-19 13:39:09 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The American people are strong. The American people will win this fight against the coronavirus.  The Senate’s job is to give them the tools to make that happen.  And we are not leaving until we do our job.
1240684597622562817 2020-03-19 13:00:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This crisis is moving fast. Our health system is under strain and our economy is hurting. It is critical that we act swiftly and boldly to stabilize our economy, preserve Americans’ jobs, get money to workers and families, &amp; keep up our fight on the health front.
1240384001954787332 2020-03-18 17:06:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate just passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. It is on its way to @POTUS's desk.

1240309847616356353 2020-03-18 12:11:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate majority's bold proposal will put forward an historic injection of liquidity and access to credit for American small businesses — with minimal new bureaucracy, so the assistance can flow as fast as possible.   The Senate is not going to leave small business behind.  https://t.co/B2prmurcAR
1240306183103229953 2020-03-18 11:56:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Many American small businesses are in enormous jeopardy. For the sake of public health, local officials are winding down their commerce. We need to help them through this extraordinary period so they can continue to make payroll and keep the United States of America in business.  https://t.co/itM4SppMjP
1240300867213017090 2020-03-18 11:35:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate is going to vote on the House’s proposal. I will support it. But it does not help enough Americans and, crucially, it adds even more uncertainty for small businesses. It will make it all the more urgent for the Senate to pass bold legislation to help small businesses.  https://t.co/R0DjHKBLrI
1240295110828589056 2020-03-18 11:12:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> All of us have seen our daily lives transformed in what feels like the blink of an eye. But we are all in this together. Our nation faces a serious challenge. But together, we can take bold steps to combat it.  https://t.co/9cl3KHjJQu
1240020462022918147 2020-03-17 17:01:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Yesterday, my home state of #Kentucky reported its first #COVID19-related death.

1239995412230082563 2020-03-17 15:21:58 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It is my intention that the Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps, above and beyond what the House passed, to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm.
1239942135056683008 2020-03-17 11:50:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate is continuing urgent talks on additional legislation to address three major priorities:  1.

1239932188969369603 2020-03-17 11:10:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> At every level, the coronavirus outbreak is testing our nation and our institutions. We cannot afford partisan politics as usual.   This week, the Senate must continue to take bold and bipartisan action.
1239684389522542594 2020-03-16 18:46:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Republicans believe the proposal the House is still processing can only be the beginning of Congress’s work to protect our economy &amp; stand with the American people.  We'll need further bold steps to support Americans, secure the U.S. economy, &amp; ready our healthcare system.  https://t.co/NGDQslbETa
1239663307356811265 2020-03-16 17:22:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate is still waiting for the House to finish processing their coronavirus legislation and transmit their final version to us.   Senators on both sides are eager to act quickly to support American workers, families, and small businesses.

1238691217711513600 2020-03-14 00:59:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> My statement on President Trump’s actions today and the House-passed coronavirus legislation:  https://t.co/3Bb9XYH8Jh
1238231958129442818 2020-03-12 18:34:38 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> .@SenatorFischer’s bipartisan PREP Act would expand medical professionals’ access to vitally-needed respirators and create certainty for mask manufacturers. It is not controversial. The Senate could have passed it today.  But Senate Democrats refused to let it move forward.  https://t.co/OFMgOdC2eq
1238152886980395009 2020-03-12 13:20:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Notwithstanding the scheduled state work period, the Senate will be in session next week. I am glad talks are ongoing between the Administration and Speaker Pelosi. I hope Congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong.
1238113288975761411 2020-03-12 10:43:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Fortunately, we do not need to choose between Speaker Pelosi’s first draft and doing nothing. I am glad the Administration is continuing talks. The Senate is ready to consider a bipartisan, bicameral package if House Democrats return to the table &amp; work with the President's team.
1238113287063117824 2020-03-12 10:43:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi’s first draft from late last night was off-base. It does not focus immediate relief on affected Americans. It proposes new bureaucracy that would only delay assistance. It wanders into policy areas that are not related to the pressing issues at hand.
1238113285586763777 2020-03-12 10:43:04 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I applaud Sec. Mnuchin and the Administration for engaging in bipartisan talks with Speaker Pelosi. Following the billions in health funding we approved last week, the Senate is ready and eager to consider bipartisan policies to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus.
1237872870920835073 2020-03-11 18:47:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> My home state of Kentucky currently has eight confirmed coronavirus cases. I applaud the efforts of state and local leaders who are working together with federal officials to proceed carefully and intelligently.  https://t.co/ooizhHtRLM
1237854398505578503 2020-03-11 17:34:21 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I strongly support the FISA legislation that just passed the House by a wide bipartisan majority. It will reauthorize vital tools for our national security while implementing reforms to address the abuses we saw in 2016. Our full joint statement:  https://t.co/pWrz7YsAuN
1237804450418491396 2020-03-11 14:15:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Election security has come a long way since the passivity &amp; failures of the Obama administration in 2016. But this work is not finished. We must stay vigilant — all of us. Federal leaders. State &amp; local elections officials. We all have a part to play in protecting our democracy.  https://t.co/lqXsiojhPy
1237756436354150404 2020-03-11 11:05:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Congress has acted proactively by providing billions in funding to health leaders as they combat this virus on the front lines. I am confident we can bring the same bipartisan energy to any steps that prove necessary to support our strong &amp; healthy U.S. economy.  https://t.co/KhUln8Wslb
1237485225791406081 2020-03-10 17:07:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We have not had a major update of our energy laws in over a decade. Let’s not squander this opportunity. Let’s get this done. The American people deserve this commonsense, bipartisan legislation.  https://t.co/eSZ8KlDnzt
1237444334506643460 2020-03-10 14:24:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This coronavirus poses a challenge, no question. But our nation is strong, we are well equipped, and we have overcome far greater challenges before.  As the @VP put it yesterday: “We’re all in this together.”  https://t.co/YOJSivKuaw
1237398868486225920 2020-03-10 11:24:14 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I encourage all my Senate colleagues to attend today’s briefing on election security. A subject this serious demands some bipartisanship and unity. Let’s keep the focus on fighting against foreign interference, not fighting each other.
1237391198328745984 2020-03-10 10:53:45 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The time is now for all Americans to engage in basic common-sense measures, and for Americans at heightened risk to take additional precautions. The experts’ detailed recommendations for individuals, families, and employers are available online at  https://t.co/DqOklcURnW.
1237142095023964160 2020-03-09 18:23:55 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Officials in my home state of Kentucky are currently monitoring four confirmed coronavirus cases. I spoke to the Governor this morning and will continue to stay in close touch to make sure that Kentucky — and all 50 states — have what they need and know Congress has their back.  https://t.co/XjdM9Y6GjW
1237130170101891072 2020-03-09 17:36:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Green New Deal is 100% the wrong way to think about American energy dominance. Fortunately, the legislation before the Senate now gets it right: The bipartisan American Energy Innovation Act.  https://t.co/vNN9wejKuW
1237112823009992704 2020-03-09 16:27:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Congress is making sure our health experts &amp; leaders have the funding they need to combat the coronavirus. We passed nearly $8B in supplemental funding. These surge resources will help public health leaders, researchers, &amp; state and local governments work to protect Americans.
1236061134429597696 2020-03-06 17:48:34 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I hope we can restore the bipartisan consensus that has served our nation, Israel, and the world so well. But we need to fight for it. #AIPAC2020
1236033246271594497 2020-03-06 15:57:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’ve worked my whole career to stand against anti-Semitism. We must denounce it wherever it emerges.   This is a responsibility that all Americans must share.  https://t.co/uqdSWfkEK3
1235993596756664320 2020-03-06 13:20:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Thank you @KYFB for coming to Washington. It’s an honor to work in the Senate on behalf of #Kentucky farm families.  https://t.co/FEPWdrzAbx
1235960032312913932 2020-03-06 11:06:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In a time of intense partisanship, Republicans &amp; Democrats came together in a matter of days, reached an agreement with the administration, and just signed into law a bipartisan, bicameral response to help healthcare professionals combat the coronavirus.  https://t.co/AVxlZlbBRu
1235769901677260800 2020-03-05 22:31:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> 📺 TUNE IN: I will be joining @foxnewsnight with @ShannonBream ~11:00PM ET to discuss coronavirus funding and Senator Schumer's attack on SCOTUS. @FoxNews  https://t.co/xTgYO7KDuJ
1235700184698548226 2020-03-05 17:54:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Independence from political passions is the cornerstone of the judiciary in this country. It has almost been a century since the last time Democrats threatened to pack the Supreme Court b/c they wanted different rulings. History still judges that disgraceful episode to this day  https://t.co/dFmiTKmQWo
1235658873543028736 2020-03-05 15:10:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The left-wing campaign against the federal judiciary did not begin yesterday. There is a clear record of Democrats threatening the judicial independence of the Supreme Court:  https://t.co/rRnl5jupFw  https://t.co/t4etGUKili
1235626781333434368 2020-03-05 13:02:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Every time Democrats try to threaten sitting justices, we are reminded exactly why the Framers gave them life tenure and salary protection. Republicans are absolutely and unshakably committed to the core constitutional principle of an independent federal judiciary.  https://t.co/beZ7VmICsk
1235602221775101954 2020-03-05 11:25:00 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Contrary to what the Democratic Leader has tried to claim, he very clearly was not addressing Republican lawmakers. The minority leader of the United States Senate threatened two associate justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Period.  https://t.co/DZJb5qW7yO
1235250853533143041 2020-03-04 12:08:47 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Experts estimated the #GreenNewDeal could have cost the U.S. more than the GDP of the entire world. Instead, the bipartisan American Energy Innovation Act we’re considering will direct responsible and targeted investment toward key energy priorities.  https://t.co/FTyUxnBjAA
1235233746607013888 2020-03-04 11:00:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This moment calls for collaboration and unity to combat the coronavirus. Bicameral, bipartisan talks have made great headway on a funding package. It’s time to get it done and give our public health experts and healthcare professionals the surge resources they need.
1234962709462102016 2020-03-03 17:03:49 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> On the coronavirus, the Senate’s immediate role is clear: We need to support the federal, state, and local health officials and healthcare professionals who are working overtime to blunt, delay, and mitigate the spread of the virus.  https://t.co/lVTjwJ3OVl
1234867406310453248 2020-03-03 10:45:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The American Energy Innovation Act, put forward by Chairman @lisamurkowski, is thoroughly bipartisan. It takes proactive steps to ensure the security, efficiency, and affordability of American energy for years to come.  https://t.co/EZQ4UbYTPt
1234850117670391811 2020-03-03 09:36:25 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The American people deserve a debate about how best to stand with Israel. How best to lead in the world. Not whether to do so at all.  I hope we can restore the bipartisan consensus that has served our nation, Israel, and the world so well. But we need to fight for it. #AIPAC2020
1234849795161886720 2020-03-03 09:35:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’ve worked my whole career to stand against anti-Semitism. I’ve called it out whenever I see it. But around this time last year, House Democrat leaders had difficulty doing even that.   This is a responsibility that all Americans must share. #AIPAC2020
1234848739635974145 2020-03-03 09:30:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We can't ignore that in today’s Democratic Party, what were once easy questions have become divisive flash points:  Standing with Israel. Maintaining our presence in the Middle East.    Increasingly these things are controversial. #AIPAC2020
1234847668788236289 2020-03-03 09:26:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In many ways, #AIPAC2020 marks a promising time for the U.S.-Israel relationship. We in the pro-Israel community have much to celebrate.   But we must also be honest and clear-eyed about challenges. And that includes a dangerous shift in our politics here at home.
1234847323441811458 2020-03-03 09:25:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am proud to join @AIPAC in witnessing to the world-changing friendship between the United States and Israel. Join me LIVE at #AIPAC2020  https://t.co/OblL43M4HG
1234631774338199552 2020-03-02 19:08:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> After years in Afghanistan, two things are clear:   1. We should welcome any serious opportunity to bring greater stability.  2. And we must make certain that the progress won through great sacrifice is not undermined by any precipitous rush for the exits.  https://t.co/5fj5sFmnqI
1234615939548766208 2020-03-02 18:05:52 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I am grateful that the lynchpin of @POTUS' agreement with the Taliban is a conditions-based approach that will give our commanders leverage to test the Taliban’s will to abide by it. This war is not over. But this agreement may foster the negotiations to bring it toward a close.  https://t.co/cSHZvkoVvs
1234587244524179458 2020-03-02 16:11:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’m glad that our prospects for supplemental coronavirus appropriations rest in the hands of a bipartisan group of negotiators. I would encourage my Democratic colleagues to let them do their work. It will be important to pass this first benchmark &amp; supply these important funds.
1234587243068698625 2020-03-02 16:11:50 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It goes without saying that a challenge like the coronavirus leaves no time for moving goalposts or performative outrage. The American people deserve for Congress to meet this subject head-on with a bipartisan and collaborative approach.
1233523455028580354 2020-02-28 17:44:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> 📺I sat down with @CBNNews' @AbigailCBN to discuss reshaping the courts &amp; defending innocent human life:  https://t.co/ULQbf8qVnt
1233424237999902720 2020-02-28 11:10:28 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Thank you @KYFB for the warm reception. It’s an honor to work in the Senate on behalf of #Kentucky farm families and represent the home of great statesmen like Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln. #KYinDC  https://t.co/FQL3i2Ogsq
1233061501231038470 2020-02-27 11:09:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The continued spread of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, has the world on notice. Congress’s task is to make sure that the administration and our dedicated medical professionals have what they need to continue preparing in ways that are calm, smart, and effective.  https://t.co/lYw94CNSMa
1232776451516194816 2020-02-26 16:16:24 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> For generations, our nation has been powered by workers like the miners in Kentucky’s coal fields. I was honored to protect their pension benefits. I am proud to stand with and support our miners and their families. @MineWorkers  https://t.co/kJusiq9DoU
1232690393155850241 2020-02-26 10:34:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It’s an honor to be among @KYFB friends. Thank you for coming to Washington to speak for our agricultural communities and rural values. With your advocacy, I’m going to keep putting the priorities of #Kentucky families at the center of the national discussion. #KYinDC  https://t.co/LjUARishcH
1232445557257326592 2020-02-25 18:21:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Do our Democratic colleagues really believe that what our country needs is a radical fringe position on elective abortion that we only share with China, North Korea, and four other countries in the entire world?  https://t.co/DvYCXFUkHI
1232360726087553030 2020-02-25 12:44:27 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today, every Senator will be able to take a clear moral stand. We’ll have the chance to proceed to two commonsense pieces of legislation that would move our nation closer to the international mainstream with respect to defending innocent human life.  https://t.co/AfKbycHhD3
1230928411469713409 2020-02-21 13:52:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Invasive #AsianCarp presents a serious danger to Kentucky's pristine waters which impacts anglers, boaters, &amp; businesses. #Kentucky continues to lead the national fight against Asian carp &amp; I'm proud to work w/local leaders &amp; President Trump to protect our communities &amp; economy.  https://t.co/YjtEjHlVWx
1230593711295418368 2020-02-20 15:42:58 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> #Kentucky’s treasured coal communities are a central part of our Commonwealth’s heritage. I am proud to stand with our coal miners and their families. Together, President Trump and I have ended Obama’s regulatory War on Coal. Now we’re doing all we can to repair the damage.
1230211043651203073 2020-02-19 14:22:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Individuals trapped in a cycle of addiction often need assistance to find living &amp; employment, which are vital to their long-term recovery. I am proud that my CAREER Act, which supports transitional housing &amp; authorizes an increase in funding, is delivering for Kentuckians.
1229450544168787977 2020-02-17 12:00:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today we celebrate the presidents who’ve defended and shaped our great nation — especially George Washington and Kentucky’s son Abraham Lincoln. Happy #PresidentsDay.  https://t.co/lPFmBTbUDM
1228430198229622784 2020-02-14 16:25:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In divided government, we have to work on things we agree on.  House Democrats’ left-wing fantasies like the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-None are nonstarters.  https://t.co/jBj6YlZChs
1228396391300501504 2020-02-14 14:11:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> My job is to set the priorities. I think the most important long-term thing we can do for the country is confirming men and women who believe their job is to actually interpret the law as it is written. It’s my top priority.  https://t.co/INE4U2zOrw

1228056358739726336 2020-02-13 15:40:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This President’s opponents talk all the time about defending norms and institutions. That talk proved very cheap. This partisan impeachment was a series of attacks on the bedrock institutions of our republic.  https://t.co/vvTdmk1HkC
1228017203464867842 2020-02-13 13:04:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In order to politically attack one President they do not like, Washington Democrats proved willing to attack our underlying institutions themselves — the House, the Senate, the office of the presidency, and even the Supreme Court. All for short-term partisan gain.  https://t.co/sjybEA7otC
1227987563086041095 2020-02-13 11:07:04 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Before Democrats’ reckless impeachment moves fully into the rear-view mirror, I spoke again on the Senate floor about the partisan abuses that drove this process and why they must never happen again.  https://t.co/sWRuPRSMYu
1227740420966404097 2020-02-12 18:45:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I was honored to meet with representatives of the thousands of brave men and women in #Kentucky law enforcement who protect our communities. I’ve always been proud to work with them on keeping our officers safe. #KYinDC
1227647476238299136 2020-02-12 12:35:41 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Yesterday, Kentucky and the United States Army received some great news.

1227356687834718208 2020-02-11 17:20:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senate Democrats spent years saying “when it comes to Iran, we should never take the military option off the table.”  But now, after criticizing the successful strike on Soleimani, they want to pass a resolution to limit President Trump’s authorities.  https://t.co/IjyHS3M3dc
1227293486501724160 2020-02-11 13:09:03 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ICYMI 🎙️: This morning I joined @hughhewitt to discuss impeachment and judges. Listen below for excerpts:  https://t.co/15VcWexXbJ
1227269600498397192 2020-02-11 11:34:08 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The state of our union is strong and there’s plenty for the Senate to do to keep up this momentum for the American people.  We’ll start this week by confirming more of President Trump’s well-qualified nominees to lifetime judicial appointments.  https://t.co/atWKYFOqBI
1226989542244311042 2020-02-10 17:01:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Heavy rainfall last week damaged homes, businesses, &amp; infrastructure in Southeastern Kentucky. I’m grateful to the first responders who’ve helped many out of harm’s way. My team and I stand ready to work with local officials in the recovery process.  https://t.co/Fx0G1UkmWZ
1226881708148056064 2020-02-10 09:52:48 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Framers built the Senate to be a firewall. We held the line. We fulfilled our constitutional duty, conducted a fair trial and delivered the outcome that President Trump deserved.   Read my new op-ed in the @CourierJournal:   https://t.co/pSrwlZryKY
1225237473439166464 2020-02-05 20:59:12 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> WATCH 📺: Tonight at ~ 9:30pm ET on @FoxNews. I’ll be joining @seanhannity to discuss the conclusion of the impeachment trial.
1225191557491560448 2020-02-05 17:56:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The architects of this impeachment claimed they were defending norms and traditions. In reality, it was an assault on both. They attacked due process, the office of the presidency, and the Senate’s sole power to try impeachments.  https://t.co/3iHVzbTFW7
1225162561760497665 2020-02-05 16:01:31 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Moments like this are what the Senate was made for. The Framers knew the country would need a firewall to keep partisan flames from scorching our Republic.   So they created the Senate. Today, we will fulfill this founding purpose.
1224898906766675968 2020-02-04 22:33:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> For three years, Republicans in Congress have partnered with the President to keep America strong and safe and create record-setting prosperity for working families across the country. The results have been a truly all-American comeback. The state of our union is strong.  https://t.co/RQDdh8u9zo
1224801115407110151 2020-02-04 16:05:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Tomorrow, the Senate will put a stop to this reckless and partisan abuse of power by the House majority.  I urge every one of my colleagues to cast the vote that the facts in evidence, the Constitution, &amp; the common good clearly require.  Vote to acquit the President.  https://t.co/LaIRnA98P6
1224766629520855042 2020-02-04 13:48:14 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The same Democrats who want to take over everyone’s healthcare and micromanage the entire economy couldn’t even organize their own traditional Iowa caucuses?
1224758362170064902 2020-02-04 13:15:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Washington Democrats’ position on President Trump has been obvious for three years: They believe he committed a “high crime [or] misdemeanor” the moment he defeated Secretary Clinton in the 2016 election.   That is the original sin of this presidency: That he won and they lost.  https://t.co/FOzXEd0lL3
1224730691193266176 2020-02-04 11:25:25 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Framers knew that overheated House majorities might impeach on purely partisan grounds. But they knew that short-term passions could not get the final say. So they placed the ultimate judgment not in the fractious lower chamber, but in the sober and stable Senate.  https://t.co/tvT7IybPwU
1224693801287147528 2020-02-04 08:58:50 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> At 9:30am, I will speak on the Senate floor about the president’s impeachment trial and tomorrow’s conclusion to this process.  https://t.co/FLIB5sn34B
1223376795854155778 2020-01-31 17:45:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> A majority of the U.S. Senate has determined that the numerous witnesses and 28,000-plus pages of documents already in evidence are sufficient to judge the House Managers’ accusations and end this impeachment trial.   My full statement:  https://t.co/SmXFoME7TO
1221886061992927235 2020-01-27 15:01:53 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> 75 years ago today, the Allies liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau. We must never forget the 6 million Jewish people murdered by the Nazis and the horrors of the Holocaust. And we must renew our resolve to confront anti-Semitism wherever it takes root. #HolocaustRemembranceDay
1220756382456209409 2020-01-24 12:12:56 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It was great to meet and thank Kentuckians who traveled to Washington for the March for Life.

1219848237907173376 2020-01-22 00:04:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> There were good reasons why all 100 senators agreed two decades ago that the Senate should not cross these bridges before we came to them. We will not let the architects of the unfair House process convince the Senate to rewrite our rules just for President Trump.  https://t.co/7J1zDlnwI4
1219826046125641733 2020-01-21 22:36:07 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The way the Senate decides to handle mid-trial questions such as witnesses could have institutional consequences that go far beyond this trial and this presidency. We are not going to rush into these questions without even hearing opening arguments.  https://t.co/taulxHiJJK
1219790888714612738 2020-01-21 20:16:25 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It will be telling if the House managers try to get the Senate to pre-commit ourselves to supplementing the investigation they themselves oversaw and decided to shut down. Just last week, they said their case as it already exists is “overwhelming” and “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  https://t.co/RXcjay4Ana
1219696166339796995 2020-01-21 14:00:01 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In 1999, the Senate unanimously agreed on a basic trial structure that was fair to all parties. Today, we must rise to the occasion and preserve that bipartisan precedent. Our resolution sets up the same basic steps. Fair is fair.  https://t.co/tQjlpDBj8F
1219259384724959232 2020-01-20 09:04:24 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today we celebrate the life and legacy of one of America’s greatest heroes. Dr. King’s strength and heroism made our country stronger and more just. By sharing his dream, he awoke a nation.  https://t.co/3pYru5Ibko
1217951674175758338 2020-01-16 18:28:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> ‘This body, this chamber, exists precisely so that we can look past daily dramas and understand how our actions will reverberate for generations. The House’s hour is over. The Senate’s time is at hand. It is time for this proud body to honor our founding purpose.’  https://t.co/MYYkUmgV84
1217856582433878019 2020-01-16 12:10:10 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> BREAKING: The Senate just passed the USMCA. Next stop: @POTUS’s desk for his signature.  I’m grateful to the President for prioritizing this deal and delivering on this major promise. It’s a big win for Kentucky and for American families in all 50 states.  https://t.co/vgabr9QxDN
1217841119729475585 2020-01-16 11:08:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Yesterday, the Speaker celebrated impeachment with souvenir pens, bearing her own golden signature, brought in on silver platters. The House’s partisan process distilled into one last perfect visual. Not solemn or serious. A transparently political exercise from beginning to end.  https://t.co/AshajRLH2F
1217613653983272960 2020-01-15 20:04:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The framers built the Senate to break these kinds of partisan fevers. To stabilize our institutions and protect our country. To stop short-term passions from destroying our long-term future. That is the Senate's duty. That is what we must do when this trial begins.
1217613653106679808 2020-01-15 20:04:51 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Democrats’ impeachment has been nakedly partisan from the beginning. Pelosi admits it was in the making years before events with Ukraine. Schumer says that whatever happens, if it helps him politically, it’s a “win-win.” They are playing political games with the Constitution.
1217552859052630016 2020-01-15 16:03:17 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> These two things cannot both be true. Is House Democrats’ case so “overwhelming” that it was enough to impeach a president? Or is their case so weak and incomplete that they need the Senate to redo it? They can’t even stick to one story.
1217552857806901249 2020-01-15 16:03:16 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Even today, the Speaker and her allies keep contradicting themselves. They say their case is already “overwhelming,” “beyond any reasonable doubt.” But they also keep asking the Senate to re-do their homework and add to the investigation that House Democrats rushed to close.
1217518809453678592 2020-01-15 13:47:59 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It looks like today’s the day. House Democrats may finally stand behind the rushed, unfair, and nakedly partisan impeachment that they themselves delayed for four weeks. The ‘prosecutors’ have finally overcome their cold feet.
1217224422395994112 2020-01-14 18:18:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It’s clear Democrats see impeachment as one big political game. Sen. Schumer told reporters that as long as the process hurts Republicans, “it’s a win-win.” The country deserves better. We’re overdue for some seriousness and sober judgment. That is what the Senate will bring.  https://t.co/aZU5pMQ2ah
1217191072868249600 2020-01-14 16:05:40 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We’ve reached a simple contradiction. The House case cannot be so robust that it was enough to rush into impeachment, and enough for Senate Democrats to start pre-judging guilt, but also so weak that they need the Senate to go fishing. These two stories cannot both be true.  https://t.co/r3LA9nRhlr
1217151620460445697 2020-01-14 13:28:54 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> First, Democrats spent weeks saying the House case was totally convincing. Now, the opposite: They say the House case is so thin that if the Senate judges what the House actually voted on, it's a “cover-up."  Their own investigation was so shallow that it now equals a “cover-up”?  https://t.co/08ZrAIqqFb
1217123123398574080 2020-01-14 11:35:40 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In December, House Democrats pulled the plug on their investigation and impeached because they said it was urgent &amp; they had already proven their case. But now they’ve delayed for weeks to insist that the Senate re-open their inquiry.  So – neither urgent nor persuasive?
1216893148686843904 2020-01-13 20:21:50 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It should not take brave Iranians to remind American leaders that Tehran has been a force for bad and the United States is a force for good. I hope this can be a lesson to those who’ve let domestic political grievances pollute their judgment.  https://t.co/hRvz7rHRJa
1216866843228561408 2020-01-13 18:37:18 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> If House Democrats were confident their own investigation was persuasive, they would not be so desperate to get the Senate to reopen it. The House has signaled they're afraid for the Senate to judge the case they will actually send us. The case they voted for.  https://t.co/oqhg2drPdY
1216847278520045568 2020-01-13 17:19:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’m glad the Speaker may finally be realizing she never had any “leverage” to dictate Senate procedure to Senators. The Senate was never going to pre-commit ourselves to redoing the prosecutors’ homework for them.  https://t.co/DwOeWWvYgy
1215383641297170432 2020-01-09 16:23:35 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Today is #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay and I wanted to take a moment and honor all law enforcement officers, especially our Kentuckians in uniform and their families. Thank you for your service.  https://t.co/FQyQNefhWs
1215311290996006919 2020-01-09 11:36:05 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This is a challenging time to create bipartisan agreement. But the Speaker Pelosi has managed to do the impossible. She has created growing bipartisan unity — in opposition to her own reckless games with impeachment.
1215087280618188800 2020-01-08 20:45:57 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> A majority of the Senate has decided that the first phase of an impeachment trial should track closely with the unanimous bipartisan precedent that all 100 senators supported for the first phase of the Clinton trial in 1999.
1215015467728982017 2020-01-08 16:00:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> There will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure. We will not cede our authority to try this impeachment. The House Democrats’ turn is over. The Senate has made its decision. This is for the Senate, and the Senate only, to decide.
1214961727378472962 2020-01-08 12:27:03 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I agree with @POTUS: The United States does not seek conflict but is prepared to protect American lives and interests. Iran should not question our collective will by launching further attacks.  My full remarks:  https://t.co/UyRgnDxGiS
1214634135752450055 2020-01-07 14:45:19 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It’s almost as though this House Democrat majority systematically took all of the framers’ warnings about partisan abuses of the impeachment power &amp; thought, “sure, let’s do that.”   The American people deserve better.  https://t.co/p8nJDOGZtm
1214597440797626369 2020-01-07 12:19:30 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I respect my friends across the aisle, but it appears that one symptom of “Trump derangement syndrome” is a bad case of amnesia.
1214588262263787521 2020-01-07 11:43:02 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> How embarrassing and revealing for House Democrats to spend weeks telling the American people their partisan impeachment was so very urgent — and then delay it for political purposes.  https://t.co/cQnB3uEKhz
1214329899013550080 2020-01-06 18:36:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> In the Senate, overheated partisan passions are supposed to give way to sober judgment. Can we not wait until we know the facts? Can we not maintain a shred of unity for five minutes before deepening partisan fights? We are all Americans first and we are all in this together.
1214329897608499201 2020-01-06 18:36:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> It was sad to see some Senate Democrats rush to blame our own administration before even knowing the facts. Rush to split hairs about intelligence before being briefed on it. Rush to downplay Soleimani’s evil while presenting our own president as the villain.
1214329896538968070 2020-01-06 18:36:23 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I’m glad that the administration will hold an all-senators briefing on Wednesday on recent events with Iran. It will be led by Secretary of Defense Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley, Secretary of State Pompeo, and CIA Director Haspel.
1214306255340285953 2020-01-06 17:02:26 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> They should not disdain our Constitution by rushing through a purely partisan impeachment process and then toying around with it.  Governing is serious business. The American people deserve better than this.  https://t.co/VCFI6RmALo
1214306192572473345 2020-01-06 17:02:11 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> House Democrats continue to play political games with their partisan impeachment of the commander-in-chief. Even with a process this constitutionally serious, even with tensions rising in the Middle East, House Democrats are treating impeachment like a political toy.  https://t.co/v6GmJvCOUJ
1214306087500951554 2020-01-06 17:01:46 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate’s unanimous bipartisan precedent from 1999 left witnesses &amp; other mid-trial questions to the middle of the trial. House Democrats may have scrapped their own precedents to hurt President Trump but they do not call the shots in the Senate.  https://t.co/S3YVJiivsq
1213189190667636736 2020-01-03 15:03:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We can’t hold a trial without the articles. The Senate’s own rules don’t provide for that. So, for now, we are content to continue the ordinary business of the Senate while House Democrats continue to flounder. For now.
1213189189392588801 2020-01-03 15:03:37 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> If the House ever musters the courage to stand behind their slapdash work product and transmit their impeachment to the Senate, it will be time for the United States Senate to fulfill our founding purpose.
1213189186003578892 2020-01-03 15:03:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> We exist because the founders wanted an institution that could stop momentary hysterias and partisan passions from damaging our Republic. An institution that could be thoughtful, be sober, and take the long view.
1213189184648876032 2020-01-03 15:03:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The framers built the Senate to provide a check against the short-termism, the runaway passions, and the “the demon of faction” that Hamilton warned would “extend his sceptre” over the House of Representatives “at certain seasons.”
1213162749531955202 2020-01-03 13:18:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> I know I speak for the entire Senate when I say that my prayers are with all American diplomats, personnel, and brave servicemembers serving in Iraq and the Middle East.  I am grateful for their courageous service to protect our nation.
1213162747137011712 2020-01-03 13:18:33 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> For too long, this evil man operated without constraint, and countless innocents have suffered for it. Now his terrorist leadership has been ended.
1213162744746270723 2020-01-03 13:18:32 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Soleimani made it his life’s work to take the Iranian revolutionary call for “death to America” and “death to Israel” and turn them into action. No man alive was more directly responsible for the deaths of more American servicemembers than Qassem Soleimani.
1213162509743640581 2020-01-03 13:17:36 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> This morning, Iran’s master terrorist is dead. The architect and chief engineer for the world’s most active state sponsor of terrorism has been removed from the battlefield at the hand of the United States military.  https://t.co/EfERQOYThW
1213149960474107905 2020-01-03 12:27:44 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> Senators do not cease to be senators just because the House sends us an impeachment. Our job remains the same: represent our states’, our constituents’, and our nation’s best interests. That is our obligation whether we are voting on legislation, nominations, or impeachment.
1213149958200803328 2020-01-03 12:27:43 -0400 <LeaderMcConnell> The Senate will soon have to address some of the deepest institutional questions contemplated by our Constitution. We’ll have to decide whether we are going to safeguard core governing traditions or let short-term partisan rage overcome them.
