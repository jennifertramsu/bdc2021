1371489205596131333 2021-03-15 11:51:22 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Donald Trump embodied energy in the executive.   Joe Biden embodies Geritol in the executive.
1371468503232958464 2021-03-15 10:29:06 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The media built Cuomo up to be some great oracle of response to coronavirus.  The reality is, killing 15,000 people in the state of New York should be impeachable.   https://t.co/zoXPOs3kSZ

1370065619048095750 2021-03-11 12:34:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I voted against the Democrats‚Äô gun control plan because law-abiding Americans should not be presumed guilty or suspicious merely because they are gun owners.

1367325617126014976 2021-03-03 23:06:45 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Election fraud should be investigated, not legitimized through the provisions of this legislation that legalize ballot harvesting and ensure a growing, unmanageable universe of mail ballots. (3/4)
1367325616454963205 2021-03-03 23:06:45 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> House Democrats apparently think voting is less worthy of identity protection than boarding aircraft or buying cigarettes. (2/4)

1366782240462696448 2021-03-02 11:07:34 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The fake news media and their allies in Silicon Valley made Governor Cuomo out to be some iconic cross between King David and Tom Brady.  What a big lie that turned out to be.   https://t.co/JJKEpAGgw3

1360246030898503684 2021-02-12 10:15:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Interesting how a lot of people who end up being anti-Trump wanted jobs with Trump...  (Romney, Kinzinger, etc.)  They became critics when they didn't get the job they wanted.
1360072351791144965 2021-02-11 22:44:52 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Donald Trump was a threat to the Establishment in BOTH parties.  The Republican Party should still be the #AmericaFirst party.  https://t.co/N3uKFiyKtn
1360037271529996291 2021-02-11 20:25:28 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> TONIGHT: I'll be on @IngrahamAngle to talk about why the #AmericaFirst agenda must survive within the Republican Party. TUNE IN to @FoxNews at 10:20pm ET/9:20pm CT
1359955867781668865 2021-02-11 15:02:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats are obsessed over President Trump...and it's because they have no agenda to help regular Americans.
1359933721860853763 2021-02-11 13:34:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Democrats are afraid President Trump will come back stronger than ever before.  That's why they're trying to impeach him again.  https://t.co/3xgx5Cd2rR
1359913789358026752 2021-02-11 12:14:48 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President Trump will not be convicted in this impeachment trial.
1359884013805182980 2021-02-11 10:16:28 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President Trump's defense has missed the opportunity to define the President's concerns about election integrity as entirely proper.  https://t.co/B540U6NnZd
1359665461022097410 2021-02-10 19:48:01 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Democrats right now are doing everything they can to centralize power.  https://t.co/gAL7VYyT9f

1359594671249510402 2021-02-10 15:06:44 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats are offering impeachment in lieu of an actual agenda for the American people.
1359556294034751496 2021-02-10 12:34:14 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President Biden would do well to give some credence to the progress President Trump made over the last four years.  https://t.co/8w3MLbxLtF
1359519426337513472 2021-02-10 10:07:44 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats are trying to establish a standard of conduct in this impeachment that they themselves cannot live by.   https://t.co/5BM0W7l4ol
1359246797013737477 2021-02-09 16:04:24 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats are addicted to impeachment.  And they can‚Äôt shake the craving.
1359221835569786881 2021-02-09 14:25:13 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> This impeachment only exists to advance the politics of Democrats.   https://t.co/TvUwZyQUv0
1359187555099443205 2021-02-09 12:09:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Democrat Party is the party of impeachment, removal, and division.
1359171449286582276 2021-02-09 11:05:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats have figured out they have no message to unite the country except that they don't like President Trump...and they're dangerously using impeachment to prove it.  https://t.co/YWcl8OcwC8
1359156039061487619 2021-02-09 10:03:46 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats are literally using impeachment to discipline speech they don't like.   That is a dangerous precedent to set for our country.
1358966932003827712 2021-02-08 21:32:19 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President Trump's lawyers will do their job in the upcoming impeachment trial if they can show that the Democrats are trying to establish a standard of conduct that they themselves cannot live by.  https://t.co/VHTUfSgees
1358929615159500805 2021-02-08 19:04:02 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I'll be joining @seanhannity tonight to discuss the Democrats' attempts to impeach President Trump AGAIN‚Ä¶even after he has left office. TUNE IN to @FoxNews at 9:00pm ET/8:00pm CT
1358901357244264449 2021-02-08 17:11:45 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The America First mantra must survive within the Republican Party.
1358879554694176768 2021-02-08 15:45:07 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> When will Democrats actually start focusing on the American people?   https://t.co/mHQ0fYDTjx
1358827683757572096 2021-02-08 12:19:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Jerry Nadler has an "I gave at the office" approach to patriotism...that if you say the Pledge of Allegiance once, you're covered.  Americans need to see Congress uniting over SOMETHING...why can't it be over something as simple as reciting the Pledge of Allegiance?  https://t.co/NlvEF7rexE
1358809061312000001 2021-02-08 11:05:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The left thinks their personal opinions matter more than the will of the voters who choose their elected representatives.   https://t.co/bSeIsK54GM
1358787009335164928 2021-02-08 09:37:22 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Removing @RepMTG from her committees wasn't an attack on her, it was an attack on her voters.  https://t.co/Q1Zq3Q1xda
1358544568564682756 2021-02-07 17:34:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It's dangerous when Congress becomes the social media police, sitting in judgment of comments people made before they even got to Congress.  https://t.co/tlwAT2ldUA
1358515075137552392 2021-02-07 15:36:48 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Liz Cheney does not speak for me or for Wyoming.   https://t.co/hjHnq2rRRI

1358113254116122630 2021-02-06 13:00:06 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> This week, Democrats mocked Republicans because we wanted to say the Pledge of Allegiance.  It takes 15 seconds to say it.  Our country desperately needs to see how Republicans and Democrats can come together over SOMETHING...but Democrats refuse to unify even over our pledge.  https://t.co/8cGnyYX0N2
1357804642709737475 2021-02-05 16:33:48 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> These subcommittees in particular are critical to the success and growth of our district‚Äôs military aviation, test, and cyber missions, to include our burgeoning defense industrial community. I look forward to serving! (2/2)

1357732076385107973 2021-02-05 11:45:27 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Yesterday, Democrats made @RepMTG possibly one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress.  https://t.co/T0RTI5Ogxc
1357701168919687169 2021-02-05 09:42:38 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> COMING UP: I'll be on @FaulknerFocus with @HARRISFAULKNER at 11:00am ET/10:00am CT. TUNE IN to @FoxNews!
1357516460944470017 2021-02-04 21:28:40 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats in the Judiciary Committee today objected to saying the Pledge of Allegiance...one of the reasons they gave was that it is a "symbol of white supremacy," and that saying it would reinforce racism.  This divisive rhetoric from House Dems does nothing to advance unity.  https://t.co/yJxaUH4K72
1357505617502568448 2021-02-04 20:45:35 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I offered an amendment to add the Pledge of Allegiance to our Judiciary Committee procedures.  Every Democrat voted ‚Äúno,‚Äù and several mocked me for making the suggestion.  https://t.co/kiq1A4ti1m

1357432482271031297 2021-02-04 15:54:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I proposed that we begin each meeting of the House Judiciary Committee by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.  Democrats just said "no."  @RepJerryNadler said it's "unnecessary."  https://t.co/TquNSxqJzv

1357377993920839684 2021-02-04 12:18:27 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats are trying to substitute the will of Washington for the will of the people.   https://t.co/9065tO8Zu1
1357334343627268096 2021-02-04 09:25:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Republicans need to stand up and fight to win against the Democrats' rampant hypocrisy.  https://t.co/zU3Bt4Mi1y
1357155971395702786 2021-02-03 21:36:12 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Tonight, the GOP decided to keep @RepLizCheney.  Tomorrow, the Dems will boot @RepMTG from her committees.  Both decisions reinforce the power of Washington.  It encourages me to go out into America and call attention to changes needed in both parties so the voters are respected.  https://t.co/wR52s1fihv

1356335260565340160 2021-02-01 15:15:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Liz Cheney does not speak for Wyoming.   (via @OANN)  https://t.co/1ciOxpuF4g
1356312172717088768 2021-02-01 13:43:15 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The people of America understand that the policies of President Trump have made their lives better.  https://t.co/KENl5lpxs0
1356276255356833793 2021-02-01 11:20:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> There is no federal government policy that could ever be better for our economy than an OPEN economy.

1355565167585746948 2021-01-30 12:14:55 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The left wing and right wing populists have my total support on this collaboration to attack corporate welfare.  Great work @AnnaForFlorida and @AnthonySabatini.   We need more of this to beat the establishment in both parties.
1355553067345858563 2021-01-30 11:26:50 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> We are in a fight for the soul of the Republican Party.  "America First" is alive and well. It will be the prevailing ideology of our political movement.  https://t.co/i80IHTPnQS

1355200713043963910 2021-01-29 12:06:43 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> There are basically two things that Liz Cheney has done in the United States Congress: frustrate the agenda of President Trump and sell out to the forever war machine.   https://t.co/cnoqhB8dhB
1355166219398238210 2021-01-29 09:49:39 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If the Republican establishment tries to purge Trumpism and go back to America Last policies, the base of our party will not accept that.   We will demand better.  https://t.co/fXkqSjAEQj

1354455501883510784 2021-01-27 10:45:30 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The America First movement must survive and thrive within the Republican Party.
1354177091080744960 2021-01-26 16:19:12 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It's no longer acceptable for the Woketopians in Silicon Valley and Big Tech just to offer a platform for debate and discussion.   Now they want to put their thumb on the scale when it comes to people's analysis of the truth.

1353840156592250880 2021-01-25 18:00:21 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The FBI told our office this threat wasn't a crime. üëá  We've gotten two or three of these every day for weeks, but the Bureau only seems to react to threats against lawmakers with a "D" beside their name.

1353736385908371459 2021-01-25 11:08:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Biden agenda will:  ‚ùåShut down American businesses ‚ùåOpen America's borders ‚ùåCancel American jobs ‚ùåSend America's resources around the world  @JoeBiden puts America LAST.

1353080312842997765 2021-01-23 15:41:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Call your member of Congress.

We can't have leaders who would rather let America decline than embrace the America First agenda.

1353026961128341504 2021-01-23 12:09:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Big tech is targeting conservatives because we stood up for election integrity.   https://t.co/mcQTYY4EfE
1352996510661713920 2021-01-23 10:08:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Big Tech silenced the President of the United States.  Just imagine what they could do to you.   https://t.co/wOaQvfHzJz
1352696785534214144 2021-01-22 14:17:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It's difficult for Democrats to advance "unity" when they're so hell-bent on cancelling conservatives.
1352690029664071680 2021-01-22 13:50:09 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Corporate PAC money runs Washington.  There are too many people in Republican leadership right now who will do anything - including sell out former President Trump - to be back in the good graces of woke corporate America.  https://t.co/l2RC56gg6U

1352628244898582528 2021-01-22 09:44:38 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Liz Cheney emailing me a Karl Rove essay attacking Trump.  This is the current state of Republican House Leadership.  Pathetic &amp; Unworthy of the great people in the America First movement.  https://t.co/0Q1BG7IDbd
1352410785562173444 2021-01-21 19:20:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The base of the GOP is strong, but our leadership is in shambles.  Americans deserve to know if their member of Congress supports "leaders" who will allow America to decline (@Liz_Cheney, @LeaderMcConnell), or if they support leaders that promote the America First agenda.  https://t.co/jUhfVfb7Gv
1352390789331038208 2021-01-21 18:01:05 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> By embracing the language and the arguments of the radical left instead of the America First movement, Liz Cheney is spitting into the eyes of tens of millions of Americans.  https://t.co/855x7ZwWpZ

1350633765144588288 2021-01-16 21:39:17 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Twitter has taken the President of the United States out of the public discourse but allows people like the Ayatollah of Iran, who regularly cheers "death to America," to continue spewing vile hatred on their platform.

1350463862051639296 2021-01-16 10:24:09 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> For all of the criticism that Democrats have leveled against President Trump unfairly, they were the cheerleaders, fundraisers, and apologists for the people who burned our cities, attacked our police, and were on offense against the very notion of America for months this summer.  https://t.co/lhrQnqpBy7

1350087847819177984 2021-01-15 09:30:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Last week, Democrats called for unity, democracy, and healing.  This week, seeking power and political advantage, they reverted to their natural state:   The party of impeachment, removal, and division.
1349789687393751040 2021-01-14 13:45:14 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats wanted to impeach President Trump on his first AND last day in office.  In the middle, President Trump  ‚úÖRescued our economy ‚úÖRebuilt our military ‚úÖReformed the VA ‚úÖReduced America's involvement in foreign wars

1349196821332160525 2021-01-12 22:29:23 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President Trump called for protests that would be peaceful and patriotic...he got labeled a national security threat.

1349193054842982403 2021-01-12 22:14:25 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> This is a DEEPLY unpopular impeachment.  The American people wish we were here dealing with coronavirus, not the virus of Trump hatred‚Ä¶a virus Democrats seem to have found no vaccine for.  https://t.co/ROqKxJd3Gv

1348776379412865025 2021-01-11 18:38:42 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Impeachment is unnecessary, divisive, and it‚Äôs only being done because Democrats want to keep the focus on President Trump so they can hold together their fragile coalition.
1348730945285861376 2021-01-11 15:38:10 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Democrats' hatred of President Trump is the only thing that seems to unify them...so they don't care if impeachment harms the country as long as it helps them consolidate power.  https://t.co/vFpRc7s9A3

1347380326297980928 2021-01-07 22:11:17 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Outrageous hypocrisy by Democrats:  Just yesterday, Democrats were telling us we were "seditious traitors" and that they were the vanguard of all democracy.  Today, a Democrat member of Congress is saying elected members of Congress should be expelled from the House.  https://t.co/6hZBSsCCyB

1347028436481617922 2021-01-06 22:53:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> This morning, President @realDonaldTrump explicitly called for demonstrations and protests to be peaceful.  He was far more explicit about his calls for peace than some of the BLM and left-wing rioters were this summer when we saw violence sweep across this nation.  https://t.co/Ef7gKwdY1K
1347024422042030080 2021-01-06 22:37:03 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> We came today to debate, to follow regular order, to offer an objection, and to follow a process that is expressly contemplated in our Constitution.

1345920941335965697 2021-01-03 21:32:13 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Democrats have chosen their leaders: Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer.

1345754037992361984 2021-01-03 10:29:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If we truly love America, we must end birthright citizenship by fraud in the United States.
1345450789813280769 2021-01-02 14:24:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats protect their own homes with walls.  Why don't they believe the rest of America deserves that same protection?
1345389888628133889 2021-01-02 10:22:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Neocons in both parties have convinced themselves that just beyond the tenure of every despot dictator in the Middle East lies an American democracy.  If we put Joe Biden, Liz Cheney, or Nikki Haley in charge, they'd shatter Moses's record of wandering in the desert for 40 years.
1345115832586743810 2021-01-01 16:13:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> America is precious. It is one of a kind.  You don't sell a genuine original.   Our government should not be for sale to lobbyists or special interests.
1345059209700802566 2021-01-01 12:28:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "America First" does NOT mean putting:  ‚ùåOther countries first ‚ùåMultinational corporations first ‚ùåLobbyists first  It means putting the AMERICAN PEOPLE first. #MAGA
1345022971400900608 2021-01-01 10:04:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The media and Big Tech want to control what you see and hear so they can manage how you behave.
1344730543993155585 2020-12-31 14:42:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats couldn't beat @POTUS in 2016 at the ballot box.  So they tried to impeach him at the witness box.  When that failed, they ran to the mailbox.  There, they could process votes without signature matches, without observers, and sometimes without the voter even being alive.
1344700136518254594 2020-12-31 12:41:10 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The American people will NEVER give failed liberal leaders the power to shut down the American spirit or the American way of life!

1343569392991395840 2020-12-28 09:48:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Keeping Eric Swalwell on the Intelligence Committee is like putting Anthony Weiner on the Ethics Committee.
1343295588708851721 2020-12-27 15:40:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I‚Äôm not going back to yesterday‚Äôs Republican Party.  THIS IS DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PARTY!
1343218581379551234 2020-12-27 10:34:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I wasn‚Äôt elected to wait politely for Washington to improve itself.   A slow path to reform is a path to degeneracy. #Firebrand
1342946287046578176 2020-12-26 16:32:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> A Republican President hasn‚Äôt been sworn in absent Democrat congressional objection since 1988.  But when Republicans object...Democrats call us traitors.

1342868776417710080 2020-12-26 11:24:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The old GOP let the media call the shots and the liberals frame the arguments.  If you allow the Left to control the frame, they‚Äôll hang you every time.
1342838074007416834 2020-12-26 09:22:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The cancel culture wants our silence.  Don't give it to them!

1342124120469721089 2020-12-24 10:05:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It‚Äôs easy for elected officials to get distracted by the swamp if they have no principles.   The emptiest of vessels become the most corruptible of officials.  https://t.co/UN67Uzxkbo

1341881654542000131 2020-12-23 18:01:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Section 230 is a gift to tech companies, placing them above the law; furthermore, our adversaries have begun to use its expansive protections to undermine America‚Äôs national security. (3/4)
1341881653686370305 2020-12-23 18:01:31 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It greatly limits the President‚Äôs ability to remove troops from foreign lands, and to draw down endless, unconstitutional wars.   Additionally, it does nothing to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. (2/4)
1341881652847505408 2020-12-23 18:01:31 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump has done the right thing by vetoing the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).   This bill, which I opposed on the House floor, is a slap in the face to the America First movement. (1/4)
1341854845205024768 2020-12-23 16:15:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Our constitutional system reposes power in the people.  The media resents the hell out of that fact.

1341422999841374208 2020-12-22 11:39:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If you want to drain the swamp, hire a Florida man.  We know how to get it done.   https://t.co/UE240Kuryq
1341393303980232704 2020-12-22 09:41:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Hey Liberals:  Lockdowns make you look weak, not strong.   Shutting down restaurants makes you look foolish, not compassionate.  Canceling Christmas makes you a Grinch, not a leader.  You will NEVER shut down the American spirit or the American way of life.
1341204698582409216 2020-12-21 21:11:33 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It doubles down on many failed Democrat policies, giving special interests billions of dollars in perks, while giving our fellow Americans a paltry payment of only $600.   America deserves better than this swamp sludge. (9/9)
1341204697722417153 2020-12-21 21:11:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> America‚Äôs struggling workers should be prioritized over gender-specific programs in Pakistan or anti-narcotics programs in Burma, or money for Ukraine (all of which are funded in this bill). (8/9)
1341204696921493511 2020-12-21 21:11:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It continues to subsidize the heartless, reactionary lockdown ideology of Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer‚Äôs political allies. (7/9)
1341204696061526016 2020-12-21 21:11:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The other half of the Democrats‚Äô bill, however, denies a simple truth ‚Äî no amount of government-sponsored generational theft will do our people better than an open economy. (6/9)
1341204695197609985 2020-12-21 21:11:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It also did not place arbitrary and unfair limits on the President‚Äôs authority to withdraw troops ‚Äî and to draw down endless, unconstitutional wars. (5/9)
1341204694413303815 2020-12-21 21:11:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> While the Defense/Homeland Security/CJS/FSGG bill is not perfect, it provides crucial support for our servicemembers, and it gives America‚Äôs armed forces the tools they need to succeed, both now and in the future. (4/9)
1341204692701904896 2020-12-21 21:11:31 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I voted ‚Äúno‚Äù on the second half of the spending bill, which provides windfalls to corporate special interests, while simultaneously shortchanging American citizens. (3/9)
1341204691888254976 2020-12-21 21:11:31 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I voted ‚Äúyes‚Äù on the half of the bill which funds our military and provides a pay raise for the brave men and women who serve America. (2/9)
1341204691162689541 2020-12-21 21:11:31 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats quietly acknowledged the outlandish provisions in their omnibus legislation tonight by splitting their original legislation into two separate votes. (1/9)
1341178954187718657 2020-12-21 19:29:15 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Democrat Majority Leader just beat his chest and complained that there wasn't a COLA raise for Congress in the government funding bill.  https://t.co/vCkukVwFax

1339278592744812545 2020-12-16 13:37:53 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It's not some "grave attack on democracy" to use a constitutional process that invokes discussion on the House floor about election integrity.  If a debate does occur...the union will hold. #GaetzTakes    https://t.co/qIoV3OhE6U

1337823756828487683 2020-12-12 13:16:53 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Swalwell shouldn't be blamed because he was targeted by Chinese intelligence.   He should be blamed because he should've known better.

1337557705800765441 2020-12-11 19:39:42 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The true casualty of the Supreme Court's decision is an erosion of the power of state legislators to make election law.

1337427109929758726 2020-12-11 11:00:45 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> America deserves to know the facts of both the Swalwell spy story and the Hunter Biden investigation.  But the mainstream media refuses to report on them.  The media is a joke.   https://t.co/aaG1W6GTZL

1336997244453740545 2020-12-10 06:32:37 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Biden team is trying to frame the Hunter Biden investigation as a dispute about taxes or an accounting error.  This isn't about taxes. It's about foreign entanglements and selling American influence to the highest bidder-something the Bidens are apparently very familiar with.  https://t.co/LcTNHNtiby

1336785520442155009 2020-12-09 16:31:19 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Chinese Communist Party is utilizing intelligence operatives to form relationships with rising US politicians who can be useful to China if they become more powerful.

But if I give a speech to a few Republicans...that's suddenly a great public health threat.  Double standard!
1336751170900144128 2020-12-09 14:14:49 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> When Republicans are targeted by foreign intelligence operations, there are threats of investigations and prosecution.

1336675845100941312 2020-12-09 09:15:30 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> How could @RepSwalwell say he was certain @realDonaldTrump was an "agent of Russia" when he couldn't even identify the agent of China working alongside his own campaign?  https://t.co/WtTwtXy34r

1335600154062319617 2020-12-06 10:01:05 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> One year ago, the core of our patriotic community was shaken when a radical Islamic terrorist opened fire on servicemembers at NAS Pensacola.

1328455647877353472 2020-11-16 16:51:22 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Both Democrats and Republicans have spoken up about Dominion voting systems and their potential ability to alter votes. #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/4snGAWQ1Ke  https://t.co/QqeOSlMUIe
1328428879011323907 2020-11-16 15:05:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> China is not our friend.   https://t.co/AIRNDETtYM
1328410925456642050 2020-11-16 13:53:39 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Speaker Pelosi doesn't want an open vote with open amendments on her COVID bill. She knows it wouldn't survive.  If she's serious about responding to COVID in a bipartisan way, she should allow amendments and allow debate. #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/qIoV3OhE6U
1328393545913430020 2020-11-16 12:44:36 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If Dominion Voting Systems have the ability to review votes in real time as they're coming in, that would create conditions ripe for fraud.  This warrants an investigation. @SidneyPowell1  https://t.co/X927nPbUmm
1328356711850184706 2020-11-16 10:18:14 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I'm glad President @realDonaldTrump is fighting against voter fraud.  It pollutes the legal votes of all of us when tens of thousands of people signify their intent to change their address in the National Change of Address database, and yet they still vote in their old states.  https://t.co/9DxmQ1CjPc
1327790611143987201 2020-11-14 20:48:45 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The populism that President @realDonaldTrump has installed in the Republican Party germinates from the enthusiasm of our voters.  If we are faithful to our voters and not K Street PACs, we can maintain the America First brand for political generations to come.  https://t.co/bfPWWoyCmE
1327746084110823426 2020-11-14 17:51:49 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> TONIGHT: I'll be on @WattersWorld with @JesseBWatters to discuss the future of the GOP and how President @realDonaldTrump's leadership has transformed the Republican Party. TUNE IN to @FoxNews at 8:00pm ET/7:00pm CT
1327679941782237185 2020-11-14 13:28:59 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Here's my challenge to @SpeakerPelosi: put your COVID bill on the floor of the House. Open it for amendment from any member.  That would show a sincere effort to come to an agreement.  But Speaker Pelosi won't do it. She wants to play politics and try to bludgeon Republicans.  https://t.co/vElbGaQ0vf
1327408456484184064 2020-11-13 19:30:12 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The concerns over Dominion Voting Systems haven't just come from Republicans.  In December 2019, Democrat Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, and Amy Klobuchar sent letters expressing their concern with Dominion's propensity to potentially switch the result of a cast ballot.  https://t.co/f4oGpxFThB

1327370179542659078 2020-11-13 16:58:06 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Americans saw quality of life drastically improve under President @realDonaldTrump's economic policies. #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/GJeyzJLasF  https://t.co/4oVX0JvUQt
1327336563198615554 2020-11-13 14:44:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Trump economy was stronger than Obama ever had.  It was also stronger than Obama told America we could ever have.  The economic policies of @POTUS have been vindicated by record-low unemployment, wage growth, and investment in America. #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/qIoV3OhE6U
1327322272558964736 2020-11-13 13:47:44 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Georgia stands between America and socialism.   https://t.co/CjjQxsQr3S
1327303211183697922 2020-11-13 12:32:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> In the Sunshine State, we authenticate mail-in ballots as they're coming in before the election so there's not a vast opportunity for fraud.  We do it right in Florida.  https://t.co/qFhj79ynMR
1327280562327879681 2020-11-13 11:02:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> In Pennsylvania, more people over the age of 90 registered to vote in 2020 than in the prior four years combined.  An abrupt surge in voters over the age of 90...during a pandemic?  https://t.co/o70a1CoPeP
1327257410960990208 2020-11-13 09:30:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Turns out impeachment for House Democrats was the poison pill that we predicted it would be.  https://t.co/0MuKqo53f5

1326972573322797059 2020-11-12 14:38:10 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It is the ultimate utilization of government power to render people's jobs illegal and force their businesses to close.  An extended national lockdown would harm the working men and women of America.  I'll fight against it. #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/ULnuBaYO47  https://t.co/cSGBRuqMZC
1326950134610079751 2020-11-12 13:09:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If observers are not able to do their job and watch as votes are being counted, all Americans should have a lower degree of confidence in the election outcome.   We have to fix this.   https://t.co/Vp46fQBpUl
1326930955559383044 2020-11-12 11:52:47 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Voter fraud is real.  https://t.co/3YFrT4CcI3
1326672685729001479 2020-11-11 18:46:31 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> According to Michigan's election data, about 9,500 voters confirmed dead through the Social Security death index are marked in the state's mail-in voting database as having returned ballots.  I'm betting this dead vote swung overwhelmingly for Biden.   https://t.co/UaK1inCBVo
1326612444236701696 2020-11-11 14:47:08 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Every Republican state legislator has an obligation to pursue election integrity legislation in their state to ensure we do not have mass mailings of ballots.   Americans deserve to know there is integrity in the election process.  https://t.co/PibsxlZ9hp
1326569275268734976 2020-11-11 11:55:36 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Today we honor the courageous patriots who chose to guard America with their lives in order to preserve freedom, liberty, and prosperity for countless generations to come. Happy #VeteransDay  https://t.co/SZvrWPz3eA
1326360377878339584 2020-11-10 22:05:31 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> My sources tell me part of the Biden transition plan would make COVID-19 changes to the voting process permanent.   That means in EVERY FUTURE ELECTION, there would be an indiscriminate mass mailing of ballots that are extremely difficult to verify.  https://t.co/kHovgEQWlM

1326245675693187081 2020-11-10 14:29:44 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Fraud is hard to catch after the fact.  Republicans must be more aggressive as ballots are coming in to ensure fraud doesn't occur.  Ballots are now separated from their envelopes. It's difficult to do the ex post facto authentication that gives people confidence in the outcome.  https://t.co/b4Ixd3RNmc

1325819287811084289 2020-11-09 10:15:25 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Republicans must be prepared to fight against @JoeBiden's potential plan to import the domestic policy of The Squad and the foreign policy of Dick Cheney.  America should never be the world's policeman or the world's piggy bank.  https://t.co/0QEdZ14B0Q
1325626734679613441 2020-11-08 21:30:17 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump has built a GREAT Republican Party.   He remains the most powerful and influential Republican in America, and we have to build on the success he's given our party.  https://t.co/7BKJeXrNIM

1324777317659340801 2020-11-06 13:15:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The state legislature in Pennsylvania should immediately launch an investigation into voter fraud allegations in their state.  They should not appoint electors until the investigation has concluded.  PA will forever be maligned as the epicenter of fraud if they don't take action.
1324762810698575873 2020-11-06 12:17:21 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Twitter wants to control what you see so they can control how you think.

1324080221964931072 2020-11-04 15:04:59 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> When the Florida Legislature passes its implementing bill to execute on the constitutional amendment for the $15 minimum wage, they should lash it to E-Verify.  If we are going to have a high-paid entry-level workforce, let's at least make sure it's a legal workforce.

1323708332520165378 2020-11-03 14:27:14 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> We're not going back to the days of invading every country, inviting every illegal immigrant across our border, and impoverishing every town in America with bad trade deals.  President @realDonaldTrump puts AMERICA FIRST and he will keep putting America first!
1323654534099574784 2020-11-03 10:53:27 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Fight with all you have to protect and defend America.   There's nowhere else to run if we fail.
1323631517319401472 2020-11-03 09:22:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden would turn our southern border with Mexico into a turnstile for the cartels, thugs, and criminals.
1323419774001577986 2020-11-02 19:20:36 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The FBI should be investigating the plans of Antifa terrorists to riot on Election Day instead of the caravan of Trump patriots. @GaetzTakes    https://t.co/aUVXyfKYRM  https://t.co/dwixd5IVI8

1323339845612134400 2020-11-02 14:03:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I'm increasingly concerned that the FBI is just becoming an anti-Trump organization within our government that virtue signals against @POTUS and harasses his supporters.  We need to build a different kind of FBI in President @realDonaldTrump's second term.  https://t.co/BTLhHIDZUy
1323311816139804673 2020-11-02 12:11:37 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Cities aren't boarding up right now out of fear that Trump supporters are going to burn them to the ground.  They're bracing for political violence from the radical left.
1323296193770852352 2020-11-02 11:09:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden is the candidate of Wall Street donations, not Main Street success.
1323274733664804865 2020-11-02 09:44:16 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden cannot be Commander in Chief.   He can barely be commander of a sentence.

1322971699403493377 2020-11-01 13:40:07 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump has secured peace in regions that haven‚Äôt seen it for generations.   He is a transformational president.

1322636438098366466 2020-10-31 16:27:54 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden will allow the mob to burn and loot your business while he renders your job illegal.

1322231759937937409 2020-10-30 13:39:52 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I'm sick and tired of the left trying to make us all think that it is hateful or exclusive to be proud of America's heritage, history, and heroes.¬†  America is the greatest country that has ever existed.
1322197110192775168 2020-10-30 11:22:10 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> As the radical left tries to socially engineer an imaginary Woketopia, we must remain committed to the most noble political experiment in all of human history: the United States of America.
1322172954516611073 2020-10-30 09:46:11 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump ran in 2016 because he loves our country.  Joe Biden is running for another foreign paycheck.
1321956362117652482 2020-10-29 19:25:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The New York Times exaggerated Miles Taylor‚Äôs status as a senior official, because when they say ‚Äúanonymous,‚Äù it could‚Äôve been someone far more important than this loser, lackey bureaucrat. @GaetzTakes    https://t.co/qIoV3OhE6U  https://t.co/86O6hu95nD

1321855870393847813 2020-10-29 12:46:13 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump would sign legislation to help our businesses and give stimulus to our fellow Americans, but Nancy Pelosi won‚Äôt let us have that vote because she wants to bail out the bad decisions in New York City and California.
1321818186300432384 2020-10-29 10:16:28 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Today's Democratic Party has become the party of destruction.   What they don't burn down in their riots, they want to lock down with their excessive government mandates.

1321509275433340928 2020-10-28 13:48:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> These riots do not help the cause of the Democrats.  Voters are not comfortable with any political movement that embraces riots and destruction.   https://t.co/2cmixxi7ag

1321102094494040065 2020-10-27 10:50:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> We cling to our guns and our Bibles in the Panhandle, and the grip is only getting stronger.
1321078321451589640 2020-10-27 09:16:30 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> A mask mandate, at the national, state, or local level, will only build resentment between public health officials and the people.   Folks want to make this decision for themselves.
1320882887290478592 2020-10-26 20:19:55 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Congratulations to Justice Amy Coney Barrett on her confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States!  #ACBconfirmation  https://t.co/6584s1RhxH

1320805143835803649 2020-10-26 15:11:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I would call Joe Biden a figurehead in his own government, but to be a figurehead I think you have to have ‚Äúfigured out‚Äù what's going on, and I'm not sure that's the case yet for Joe Biden.
1320775225227812866 2020-10-26 13:12:07 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Fake News media continues to ignore evidence of the Biden Crime Family‚Äôs corrupt deals with foreign business leaders.   Let‚Äôs put it in terms they‚Äôll understand: #BLM!  https://t.co/yml4eDo9Xe
1320722599702188032 2020-10-26 09:43:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Republicans have accomplished and incorporated ideas that Democrats only talk and pander about like funding for HBCUs, prison reform, and criminal justice reform.  They only care about your views and goals after you vote.

1320417590301306882 2020-10-25 13:31:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If the Democrats say they can get together to riot and burn down America, I say we can get together to pray and build America up.
1320351907181961217 2020-10-25 09:10:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> America wants to open up with President @realDonaldTrump, not locked down with basement-dwelling Biden.

1320020113207209987 2020-10-24 11:11:34 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> A year ago this week, I stormed the SCIF with House Republicans and demanded access for the American people to see the closed-door Ukraine witch hunt unfold.   I will never stop taking up the defense of America.  https://t.co/NkU9d40U6w
1319837719279919108 2020-10-23 23:06:48 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Our Northwest Florida community mourns their loss and honors their patriotism. I ask that the entire nation join me in prayer for the families of these brave patriots. (4/4)

1319837717245677568 2020-10-23 23:06:47 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> On Friday evening, our nation lost two incredibly brave servicemembers when their T-6B Texan II aircraft crashed a short distance from the Florida state line. (2/4)
1319837716377423873 2020-10-23 23:06:47 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Northwest Florida servicemembers lay aside their personal safety and assume enormous risks every day during training exercises that enhance our nation's defense. (1/4)

1319740377419730944 2020-10-23 16:40:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden is the candidate of locking America down, not opening America up.
1319674443342512128 2020-10-23 12:18:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden is the defender of a corrupt status quo.
1319650284130521088 2020-10-23 10:42:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden‚Äôs family got a $3.5 million payoff and new emails show he financially benefited from his access as Vice President.  He‚Äôs not the guy to preach to the rest of us about morality and integrity.  #Debate2020
1319625622142898176 2020-10-23 09:04:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I hope @JoeBiden has his dental records on file.  That way we can at least identify the body after last night‚Äôs debate.  https://t.co/NXhiQq5buy
1319616561787801604 2020-10-23 08:28:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden said he couldn‚Äôt get anything done during his last eight years because he had a Republican Congress.  @realDonaldTrump had a Congress that impeached him, yet he still rescued the economy, rebuilt our military, created rising wages, and brokered historic peace deals.

1319398877510787073 2020-10-22 18:03:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump needs to dismantle Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúless is more‚Äù strategy and expose his willingness to kneel to the Woketopia. @GaetzTakes    https://t.co/XpSKfX0Upc  https://t.co/YqZh2ooHl6
1319368990767108096 2020-10-22 16:04:14 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Why are Democrats so insistent on having mail-in ballots sent to people who haven't asked for them?¬†  They want to create a universe of ballots that haven't been voted, may still be counted in the future, and can be harvested to get results they desire.   https://t.co/LkcH8csbl3
1319343009071304707 2020-10-22 14:21:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> We now know the truth: Democrats and Deep State officials at the FBI kept evidence of Joe and Hunter Biden‚Äôs international corruption covered up.¬†  They didn't want the facts before the country. They just wanted a politically-motivated impeachment.
1319314571786682371 2020-10-22 12:28:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Republicans will open the country up with patriotism and invite people to join us in that endeavor.  We are the country of winners. We do not have to apologize for wanting to be more prosperous.
1319288399690231815 2020-10-22 10:44:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Canceling every group among us because we don‚Äôt like their politics doesn't enhance the vibrancy and diversity of our country, it diminishes it.
1319263736830492673 2020-10-22 09:06:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The men and women of our military continue to inspire my own patriotism.  They love this country so much that they are willing to go anywhere, fight anyone, and endure any challenge for the sake of America.
1319053020030783489 2020-10-21 19:08:41 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden‚Äôs career in government has been compromised by his corrupt interests with foreign business leaders around the world. @GaetzTakes   https://t.co/DhGn83gWQE  https://t.co/go4taP9Rq1
1319022145238949892 2020-10-21 17:06:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Establishment can at times be far more dangerous to the country than the Democrats.  President @realDonaldTrump is leading the fight against the corruption of the status quo.
1318991442841251840 2020-10-21 15:04:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Joe Biden will never be able to confront the corrupt status quo because his family has financially benefitted from it.
1318968681146339330 2020-10-21 13:33:33 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If there are members of Congress who want to reject lobbyists, special interests, and PACs, I don‚Äôt care what party you‚Äôre from, I‚Äôm with you in that fight.

1318240577360723976 2020-10-19 13:20:20 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Nancy Pelosi is willing to let American businesses dry up and let families suffer because she's so desperate to deprive @realDonaldTrump of any political win for the country.

They were wrong. There WAS corruption.   President @realDonaldTrump was right to ask about it.   The Bidens were lying.

1316809175859630080 2020-10-15 14:32:27 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> My congressional colleagues should join me in refusing all PAC money from Big Tech.

1316770891611672579 2020-10-15 12:00:19 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The FBI referred questions about its seizure of the laptop and hard drive to the Delaware US Attorney‚Äôs Office, where a spokesperson said, ‚ÄúMy office can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.‚Äù

1316769890209083395 2020-10-15 11:56:20 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Last December, Joe Biden also lashed out during a Democratic primary town hall event in Iowa, where a man accused him of sending Hunter to Ukraine ‚Äúto get a job and work for a gas company, he had no experience with gas or nothing, in order to get access to .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. the president.‚Äù

1316541510880505857 2020-10-14 20:48:51 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Far too many Republicans stood in the way of President @realDonaldTrump's warriors during the phony Russia witch hunt. #GaetzTakes    https://t.co/jBEjOdB2vP  https://t.co/HLavIOVXMe
1316515621488807936 2020-10-14 19:05:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Twitter is engaged in domestic election interference.
1316484675154718720 2020-10-14 17:03:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Department of Justice should investigate Big Tech.
1316471320696295425 2020-10-14 16:09:56 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Big Tech wants to control what you see so they can control what you think and how you act.
1316459219445571585 2020-10-14 15:21:51 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Big Tech is trying to steal the election.
1316456960313696257 2020-10-14 15:12:52 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> History should judge harshly the Republicans who stood in the way of President @realDonaldTrump's warriors trying to expose the lies, crimes, and criminals of the Russia Hoax. @TheNatPulse    https://t.co/VNzsnWmqjM
1316364885559836673 2020-10-14 09:07:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> America will defeat COVID-19 just like President @realDonaldTrump did!
1316164790054780928 2020-10-13 19:51:53 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett! #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/iZnErmk008  https://t.co/Ff5wZQ3Bn3
1316099889521135618 2020-10-13 15:34:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If this were Putin saying something positive about President @realDonaldTrump, @CNN and @MSNBC would have it in the A block of every show.   https://t.co/uooKS98cbr
1316085762702663682 2020-10-13 14:37:52 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats are desperately seeking new ways to stand between President @realDonaldTrump and the voters who elected him.  It's not about serving the people.   It's all about power.   https://t.co/7yNRoXoK80
1316063041205796864 2020-10-13 13:07:34 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> America will NEVER be a socialist country on President @realDonaldTrump's watch!
1316029944535769089 2020-10-13 10:56:04 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Happy birthday @USNavy!  https://t.co/kLH03bkUq4
1315729958157848576 2020-10-12 15:04:01 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Left desperately wants to derail Judge Amy Coney Barrett with personal attacks.  That strategy could really backfire on them.  #ConfirmationHearing #SCOTUShearings  https://t.co/efy2wbbede
1315701230988034049 2020-10-12 13:09:52 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Never forget...Democrats claimed for YEARS that President @realDonaldTrump was "an agent of the Russian government."  How fake it all turned out to be.
1314997626341908483 2020-10-10 14:34:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Commission on Presidential Debates looks like more like a boring Washington, D.C. dinner party than it does real America.   I would almost rather let the cast of "Love Island" set the rules for the next debate.  https://t.co/qhci6kqhNh
1314939571617005568 2020-10-10 10:43:18 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Washington PACs don't want us to peel back the curtain and expose their corruption.  They want us to chant "drain the swamp," and then do nothing about it as they turn the swamp into their own personal mud bath.  I will never again accept a donation from a federal PAC.  https://t.co/lQrUhzLMbg
1314706379752472578 2020-10-09 19:16:41 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Big Tech must stop censoring conservatives and limiting what the American people can see.  Let us think for ourselves. #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/FlTkaCLuM5  https://t.co/6BYvopDtpI
1314662504702803970 2020-10-09 16:22:21 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Congress will not regulate Big Tech because Congress is bought off by Big Tech.  Nathan Simington isn't part of the Big Tech mafia in Washington...in fact he's prepared to go after it.   Lobbyists should be nervous.    https://t.co/uaLbDp1rTR
1314611678571646978 2020-10-09 13:00:23 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Big Tech has its thumb on the scale.  They want to hide the truth.   https://t.co/wnPzI2Y74f
1314587179373428738 2020-10-09 11:23:02 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Whether people like or dislike President @realDonaldTrump, they can see from the debates that he is a person who is in command.   He's fighting for the American people and our nation's prosperity.  https://t.co/MfIp4kgIaf
1314385729557073923 2020-10-08 22:02:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> America is tired of endless, unfocused, unconstitutional wars. #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/ORcKqtWayo  https://t.co/b3HktSCIsB
1314377507915870208 2020-10-08 21:29:52 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> When the jobs of Americans or the country's national security is on the line, you don't get to "Zoom in" to those meetings.   You have to show up.  https://t.co/qRcUmPWOA9
1314344350889865217 2020-10-08 19:18:07 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> TONIGHT: I'll be on @seanhannity to discuss the last-minute format changes from the Commission on Presidential Debates, Biden and Harris refusing to answer questions on court-packing, @SpeakerPelosi raising the 25th amendment, and more. TUNE IN to @FoxNews at 9:05pm ET/8:05pm CT
1314296184350167042 2020-10-08 16:06:43 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The "America Last" media is hard at work with the political left to get in the way of our #AmericaFirst movement.  Don't let them win.  https://t.co/tjYyZvOwrk
1314230818051690496 2020-10-08 11:46:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If Hillary Clinton had been investigated by a special counsel instead of President @realDonaldTrump, we would have exposed the Russia Hoax YEARS ago.
1313966747557474304 2020-10-07 18:17:39 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> None of the rioters who threatened the McCloskeys have been indicted.   But the McCloskeys have been indicted for protecting themselves from the mob. #DoubleStandard #GaetzTakes    https://t.co/C8ymEGYUiR  https://t.co/aSSdvD0RoE
1313891814525501442 2020-10-07 13:19:54 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Why aren't the rioters who threatened the McCloskeys being charged?   Justice should be on the side of those who are protecting their lives from the mob.
1313861368072765442 2020-10-07 11:18:55 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The @BarackObama, @JoeBiden, and @HillaryClinton regime completely fabricated the Russia hoax.  It was all FAKE.
1313632608866234371 2020-10-06 20:09:54 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Antitrust issues affect all Americans, regardless of political orientation. #GaetzTakes    https://t.co/wseTIRoThg  https://t.co/hcZa6TxGlW
1313617830621913090 2020-10-06 19:11:11 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Obama admin‚Äôs weak enforcement of antitrust laws allowed big tech companies to achieve near-monopoly status.  They have used their vast size to harm competition and consumers.  Antitrust issues like this affect all Americans. Let's work across the aisle to address them.
1313586531584684034 2020-10-06 17:06:49 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats have used the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to create an electoral advantage for themselves. @FreedomWorks    https://t.co/FtrTMzUsR3
1313511285888253955 2020-10-06 12:07:49 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If this virus can get into the Oval, there is no place where it could not possibly infect one of our fellow Americans.  We can protect the vulnerable, but we must live our lives.  No lockdown can save everyone from everything.
1313490761682481154 2020-10-06 10:46:15 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Bold ideas. #AmericaFirst leadership.   President @realDonaldTrump is leading an exciting movement - it's giving Americans hope and optimism for a brighter future.  https://t.co/6XkZ7bOy5L
1313257385784487937 2020-10-05 19:18:54 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump is getting better, and our nation is well on its way to the great American comeback! #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/hiC8mU7q8e  https://t.co/334oK8JP1d
1313198710487216129 2020-10-05 15:25:45 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> There is no lockdown that can be a panacea to save everyone from everything.
1313192641195057153 2020-10-05 15:01:38 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump is leading a political realignment in our country that puts America and the American people first.  We can't achieve our bold populist ideas with a reversion back to the Romney/Kasich/Ryan view of the world.  https://t.co/9ulpKbiuPn
1313125654897008641 2020-10-05 10:35:27 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President Trump won't have to recover from COVID.   COVID will have to recover from President Trump. #MAGA
1313107880539836416 2020-10-05 09:24:49 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Obama/Biden/Clinton regime cooked up the fake Russia collusion story before the 2016 election.  It was all a hoax, and @Comey was the inside man at the FBI.  The media, the left, and even some Republicans have now been exposed for trying to delegitimize @realDonaldTrump.  https://t.co/8YyrUlAsGG
1312512758295015424 2020-10-03 18:00:01 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> TONIGHT: I'll be joining @GovMikeHuckabee on @HuckabeeOnTBN at 8:00pm ET/7:00pm CT to talk about how President @realDonaldTrump has transformed the Republican Party and why the left hates the MAGA movement. Tune in!   https://t.co/NoJCAvCTdE
1312439402703060992 2020-10-03 13:08:32 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The answer to COVID is not to shut down, hide under the bed, and just hope the virus won't ever find us.  We should live our lives, protect the vulnerable, and recognize the critical importance of making progress on therapeutics to become more survivable against COVID-19.  https://t.co/hOPJ1Q5TiE
1312400261831430156 2020-10-03 10:33:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The radical left's movement is utterly devoid of any joy.
1312210764191596544 2020-10-02 22:00:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> When the Establishment in Washington works so hard to try and disadvantage @realDonaldTrump, it only intensifies the commitment that us in the #AmericaFirst nation have towards our president.   https://t.co/80RNbAAwYB  https://t.co/MMIePkFIBt
1312202679440084992 2020-10-02 21:27:52 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump is the hardest-working man I've ever met, he is one of the strongest, and I wish him all the best.  https://t.co/Fbzcso1YMO
1312092983639117825 2020-10-02 14:11:59 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> BREAKING: All coastal counties in Florida‚Äôs First Congressional District have now been approved for individual assistance.  Proud to work with President @realDonaldTrump, @fema, and @GovRonDeSantis to see this incredibly important aid come to NWFL!    https://t.co/lQwal5OhVq
1312059230833324033 2020-10-02 11:57:52 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> There is no doubt Hunter Biden was getting paid by a woman connected to the oligarch system in Russia, and we don‚Äôt know why.   And yet, these are the people who said @realDonaldTrump was "an agent of the Russian government" for three years...   https://t.co/t8amQRRzy2
1311844101503975424 2020-10-01 21:43:01 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Left-wing corporate elitists are funding violence in our streets. #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/8F2M4UNNRc  https://t.co/oQXK1ted6E
1311809522898481152 2020-10-01 19:25:37 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I voted against this dangerous and misguided bill, and hope that Nancy Pelosi will stop holding the American people and economy hostage. (4/4)
1311809520864292865 2020-10-01 19:25:36 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Worst of all, it slashes $600 million from state and local law enforcement at a time when they need it most. (3/4)
1311809508382040065 2020-10-01 19:25:33 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The bill bails out blue states and sanctuary cities, grants stimulus payments to illegal aliens, encourages the early release of dangerous prisoners, severely limits the operations of ICE, and repeals SALT caps for 2020. (2/4)
1311809506066812928 2020-10-01 19:25:33 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The new HEROES Act is not a serious legislative effort ‚Äî it is nothing more than Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs radical left-wing wish list, and it stands no chance whatsoever of becoming law. (1/4)
1311728251686080512 2020-10-01 14:02:40 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats are trying to create a period of uncertainty after the 2020 election.  The longer that period lasts, the greater the window of opportunity for them to try and transition power in the absence of a mandate from the voters who show up on election day.  https://t.co/03VKz6mPVV
1311677686432124928 2020-10-01 10:41:44 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats ignore acts of violence when the victims are Republican, pro-life, or @realDonaldTrump supporters.  Those lives don't matter to Democrats.
1311478632674623489 2020-09-30 21:30:46 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> We now know exactly where the Russia hoax began...and it turns out people on both sides of the aisle in Washington were lying to the American people. #GaetzTakes   https://t.co/xfXZ8cBtr9
1311450707489370114 2020-09-30 19:39:48 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Left will refuse to accept the election results unless they win.  I pray America survives the Democrats' mad and destructive lust for power.  https://t.co/xzxD0Tif6w
1311401308553981952 2020-09-30 16:23:31 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> In June, my colleagues and I sent a letter to the ATF demanding they stop crafting secret rules restricting the possession of pistol braces by American citizens.  I sent a follow-up letter yesterday after receiving no response. The ATF must stop abusing its enforcement authority.  https://t.co/HBm0N1YaFH
1311342543527915521 2020-09-30 12:30:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> There should be indictments from John Durham BEFORE the election.  https://t.co/tErgWxoCqy
1311329803094700032 2020-09-30 11:39:23 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Businesses aren't boarding up for people with MAGA hats.  It's the radical left that threatens America's safety.
1311312512621699073 2020-09-30 10:30:40 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I voted against the Democrats' "peaceful transfer of power" resolution even though I completely support the peaceful transfer of power.  The resolution was a way for Dems to attack @POTUS and disguise the fact that they will refuse to accept the election results unless they win.  https://t.co/VmZpKFSoVt

1311094833054994432 2020-09-29 20:05:41 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Judge Emmet Sullivan shouldn't be presiding in the @GenFlynn case, he should be impeached.  If the referee weren't wearing the jersey of the other team, @SidneyPowell1 would have won this case three times already.  https://t.co/PV4QybE2tF
1311068820837142528 2020-09-29 18:22:20 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats ignore heinous acts of violence when the victims are Republican, or when they‚Äôre pro-life, or when they‚Äôre Trump supporters.   Those lives don‚Äôt matter to Democrats.  https://t.co/4pPMXvjmIm

1311007527379886082 2020-09-29 14:18:46 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> There's more money laundering on K Street than the drug cartels could ever dream of. #DrainTheSwamp
1310979076237201411 2020-09-29 12:25:43 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Yesterday @SecretarySonny joined me in Jay, Florida for a town hall to discuss how Hurricane Sally impacted Northwest Florida farmers in our district.  We're here to help NWFL recover. Visit  https://t.co/lQwal5OhVq for more information from my office on the Sally recovery effort.  https://t.co/wKyUvq8ZPh
1310970038824980481 2020-09-29 11:49:48 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It is usually difficult to prove that providing something of value to an individual is directly linked to impacting whether or not they were going to vote.  But in this case, the Bloomberg team literally wrote their own admission.   https://t.co/q5Ig946VHT
1310722978678800386 2020-09-28 19:28:04 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> .@Project_Veritas has always shown a willingness to work with law enforcement.

1310670440004833283 2020-09-28 15:59:18 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I'm confident that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will advocate for the American people and be a persuasive force on the Supreme Court.  https://t.co/b4DwKU34sG

1310545306984034304 2020-09-28 07:42:04 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Senate Republicans need to pick up the pace on the confirmation process of Amy Coney Barrett.  Democrats have signaled that they will use every procedural tool at their disposal to delay this confirmation. Every hour is precious.  We should be having hearings next week.  https://t.co/LbE1TMkn29

1237172052840325125 2020-03-09 20:22:57 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I should have the COVID-19 test results back tomorrow. Health officials maintain the risk to people I have been in contact with remains low.

1237105149543428099 2020-03-09 15:57:06 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Congressman Gaetz had expected COVID-19 to impact Congress, given the elevated frequency of travel and human contact, and demonstrated his concern last week on the House Floor.   https://t.co/zb6P9bmHK7

1235637781143183361 2020-03-05 13:46:18 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Northwest Floridians should take proactive steps to minimize susceptibility by avoiding contact with anyone who is sick, washing their hands regularly, not touching their face, and staying home when sick with any type of illness.
1235637780295733249 2020-03-05 13:46:18 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> My office is in close communication with the White House and Governor DeSantis‚Äôs administration to ensure the residents of Northwest Florida are prepared to address coronavirus.

1233126420601344002 2020-02-27 15:27:03 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The American People must engage and drive the future and fate of our great nation.  Go beyond the hype of the moment and fight to defeat the swamp monsters that auction off your freedoms and seek to rob you of your liberty. #CPAC2020

1231290980403482625 2020-02-22 13:53:40 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Every major cyber warrior in the Navy will pass through Corry Station and every major cyber warrior in the Air Force will pass through Hurlburt.  Let's ensure that when they conclude their service, they want to make Northwest Florida their forever home.   https://t.co/nn4luB00F8

1230541093671972864 2020-02-20 12:13:53 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> America is in a sense of great renewal.  72% of the new jobs created in the Trump Economy have been filled by women.  https://t.co/XpYlEAz2z1
1230534059304116227 2020-02-20 11:45:56 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> We have a raging economy right now!  The American family is seeing revenue pour in as a consequence of higher wages, more productivity, more business investment and more capital coming from overseas into our nation.  https://t.co/b1wPLtRUpk
1230532807384031233 2020-02-20 11:40:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The fundamental premise of the Biden Campaign is that he is electable and he can't seem to win elections.   So now you'll have socialist Bernie Sanders against billionaire Michael Bloomberg.  https://t.co/EnTh4HFYkO

1230198855511298049 2020-02-19 13:33:57 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The corrupt Russia investigation began because the FBI and Department of Justice were infected with politics.  https://t.co/1C3SrEp4Td
1230172308783980545 2020-02-19 11:48:28 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Looking forward to joining @TheView tomorrow!
1230138210661158912 2020-02-19 09:32:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I believe McCabe should have been prosecuted for lying.  Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, and Roger Stone were all charged with misstatements, but McCabe was not charged.   It makes people believe that an old FBI business card may be doubling as a get-out-of-jail-free card.  https://t.co/ulttMYIxeF

1229814611920199692 2020-02-18 12:07:06 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The media says Bill Barr has infected the front-line prosecution teams with politics.  The reality is, those prosecutors were engaging in political retribution against Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, and maybe George Papadopoulos.  Barr has reoriented those front-line prosecutors.  https://t.co/FH8NdsHcoI
1229777824636194817 2020-02-18 09:40:56 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I believe, based on the testimony from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, that the "insurance policy" created in "Andy's office" was an effort to try and delegitimize the president both before and after his election.  https://t.co/DsdQlE7DX5
1229035198920085504 2020-02-16 08:30:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> COMING UP: I'll be on @SundayFutures with @MariaBartiromo to discuss the decision not to charge Andrew McCabe, Attorney General Barr coming to testify before the Judiciary Committee, Democrats' continued push for impeachment, and more.

1228832613340778497 2020-02-15 19:05:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Andrew McCabe leaked.   Then, he lied about leaking.   THEN, he lied about lying about leaking.  https://t.co/O7oiHvBxlC
1228782281537417217 2020-02-15 15:45:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> There's still a little swamp left to be drained at the Department of Justice.  https://t.co/Ih5Mg4hEYH
1228735736360448002 2020-02-15 12:40:03 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It‚Äôs a disgrace that Andrew McCabe isn‚Äôt going to be behind bars.   We can‚Äôt live in a world where an old FBI business card doubles as a "get out of jail free card" when people break the law.  https://t.co/cw5SLGlGSU

1227711698984935434 2020-02-12 16:50:53 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> For years, tens of thousands of animals have been euthanized after federal lab testing. I'm a proud co-sponsor of the AFTER Act, which will direct federal agencies to assist with the relocation of these precious animals into sanctuaries &amp; loving homes.     https://t.co/ORjzhdWwnF
1227673992774983680 2020-02-12 14:21:03 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Ripping up President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs speech embarrassed the House of Representatives in front of the world.   America deserves a better Speaker, and @SpeakerPelosi deserves to be held accountable.  https://t.co/Zc8EzMAH8d

1227352460676796424 2020-02-11 17:03:24 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> It is my hope that First Lieutenant Joseph Ainsworth‚Äôs situation will be eradicated for future centenarian military veterans and that his service to our country will be immortalized through the Ainsworth Act.

1227303858990391297 2020-02-11 13:50:16 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The delivery of US foreign policy is going well. I‚Äôm so proud of @POTUS for taking out the Al Qaeda leader in Yemen. That group in Yemen had claimed responsibility for killing my constituents in Pensacola. So when you look at the foreign policy outcomes, it's a great thing.  https://t.co/yV3506OcYM
1227243564024975360 2020-02-11 09:50:41 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If you look at what Robert O‚ÄôBrien has done at the National Security Council, there have been a lot of changes. It very well may have been the case that Vindman could have been out before impeachment.   Now with the changes at the NSC, I think we‚Äôll have a better crew.  https://t.co/ioqFj82ZFo
1226980444182368261 2020-02-10 16:25:08 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I introduced the ‚ÄúAinsworth Act,‚Äù which would allow centenarian vets to qualify for full pension benefits from the VA regardless of net worth.   Military vets are the heartbeat of NWFL &amp; national treasures to our country, and should be treated as such.    https://t.co/94TQm25Y6q
1226920625924714499 2020-02-10 12:27:26 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realdonaldtrump laid out a vision for America that embraced the blue collar boom.   We‚Äôre seeing more productivity, rising wages, more jobs, &amp; we‚Äôre getting folks off food stamps. What's amazing to me, these things couldn‚Äôt even get the Democrats to stand &amp; applaud.  https://t.co/RZfuAyxeaH
1226895653638414338 2020-02-10 10:48:13 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Tim Morrison, who was a senior official to LT. Col. Vindman at the NSC said that Vindman frequently used poor judgment, and he often couldn‚Äôt trust his conclusions that he came to. That information was ripened to a higher degree because of impeachment.  https://t.co/cblHjo6nc8

1226234745157115904 2020-02-08 15:02:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If I were @senatemajldr I would expel @MittRomney from the Republican Caucus.

1226190142966247425 2020-02-08 12:04:46 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> There was an attempt at a criminal coup against @realDonaldTrump.

1224896724172509186 2020-02-04 22:25:11 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!" -@realDonaldTrump #SOTU

1224894347629473792 2020-02-04 22:15:44 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "Our message to the terrorists is clear:    You will never escape American justice.    If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!" -@realDonaldTrump   #SOTU2020 #StateOfTheUnion
1224893149207760897 2020-02-04 22:10:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The radical left told us if we elected @realDonaldTrump it would strengthen our enemies and weaken our alliances.   Instead, America is stronger and more secure than ever before. #SOTU #SOTU2020 #StateOfTheUnion  https://t.co/5FJEg6rVYm
1224891891151523846 2020-02-04 22:05:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!" -@realDonaldTrump    #SOTU #SOTU2020 #StateOfTheUnion  https://t.co/tl5Bl8qlAf
1224890727232155655 2020-02-04 22:01:21 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire...I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving...the Presidential Medal of Freedom." -@realDonaldTrump   Congratulations Rush! #SOTU #SOTU2020  https://t.co/wIYdghSSHT
1224889629310099456 2020-02-04 21:56:59 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in over 30 years... We will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all. " - @realDonaldTrump #SOTU  #StateOfTheUnion  https://t.co/HxdlLeOTpp
1224887075884929027 2020-02-04 21:46:50 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "Members of Congress we must never forget, that the only victories that matter in Washington, are victories that deliver for the American people." - @realDonaldTrump #SOTU #StateOfTheUnion  https://t.co/GO6sHXlOJP

1224881481220263937 2020-02-04 21:24:36 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "We keep our promises. We did our job." -@realDonaldTrump #SOTU #SOTU2020
1224881307194359808 2020-02-04 21:23:55 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion and creed very very high." -@realDonaldTrump   #SOTU #SOTU2020  https://t.co/36VgKMhrEY
1224879888114556928 2020-02-04 21:18:17 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats are trying to have an arms race against one another to attack those who do well.   While they wage war against prosperity, President @realDonaldTrump is presiding over a blue-collar boom in our country. #SOTU #SOTU2020  https://t.co/iDBOV9sukl
1224878818801995777 2020-02-04 21:14:02 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "Jobs are booming. Incomes are soaring. Poverty is plummeting. Crime is falling. Confidence is surging.   And our country is thriving and highly respected again." -@realDonaldTrump    #SOTU #SOTU2020  https://t.co/fjpN5HFP9x
1224865136160182272 2020-02-04 20:19:40 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Our President isn't delivering the #SOTU to focus on the past.  He understands that with economic opportunities like GDP growth, rising wages and record low unemployment, we have to be a nation that looks forward.  The best is yet to come for the Trump presidency. #SOTU2020  https://t.co/BebPGyhbkW
1224852012065599488 2020-02-04 19:27:30 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Venezuela wing of the Democratic party is taking over.   I think you‚Äôll hear a contrast of that tonight from @realdonaldtrump, talking about how free people, looking for brighter economic futures, really define the destiny of our country. #SOTU  https://t.co/IkFJwDKcpR
1224793656298700800 2020-02-04 15:35:37 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "I would rather be linked to President @realDonaldTrump than @RepAdamSchiff." -@RepMarkMeadows   The American people are only intensified in their support for @POTUS because of all he has been through to get the job done. #SOTU  https://t.co/XtP12JoLqW
1224752727483453440 2020-02-04 12:52:59 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> There‚Äôs a blue-collar boom happening in this country right now.   The very people President @realDonaldTrump said he was going to give a voice to are going to send him back to the White House.
1224716900644671489 2020-02-04 10:30:37 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> This sham began as a bipartisan vote against impeachment. It will likely end as a bipartisan vote for acquittal because everyone knows the Hunter Biden deal was rotten.  No one is defending having relatives get tens of thousands of dollars a month from a corrupt foreign business.  https://t.co/EmusdqxQYs
1224539489579782144 2020-02-03 22:45:39 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> TONIGHT: I'll be LIVE from Iowa on @foxnewsnight with @RepMarkMeadows and @ShannonBream at 12:30am ET/11:30pm CT. Tune in to @FoxNews!
1224384553600483328 2020-02-03 12:30:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The military is not a feature of Northwest Florida, it is the defining characteristic.  We live among heroes. We should seek to project their love of country to the rest of the nation.  To learn how you can participate in the Veterans History Project visit  https://t.co/f2XaQZGKJC  https://t.co/838wjozTZM
1224356864407887873 2020-02-03 10:39:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> MUST-READ: "Matt Gaetz slams Don Lemon: 'He is like CNN's professional eye-roller'"   https://t.co/Dw1fucti2y
1224342215285186561 2020-02-03 09:41:45 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> This sham process began with a bipartisan vote against impeachment in the House.   Now, because of the work of @senatemajldr, @AlanDersh and others, it should end with a bipartisan vote against impeachment in the Senate.  https://t.co/xKu5PIeeEO
1224055133094367232 2020-02-02 14:41:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> "Abuse of Power" and "Obstruction of Congress" are purposefully amorphous terms because Democrats want to play politics with impeachment.  This impeachment is not about any "constitutional crisis" ‚Äì it‚Äôs about Democrats‚Äô bloodlust for power.  https://t.co/OkWAI66VHP
1223992218580668416 2020-02-02 10:31:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Hunter Biden himself admitted that the only reason he had a job with Burisma was because his dad was the Vice President of the United States handling Ukraine policy. #BidenCrimeFamily  https://t.co/xsDI2O3cJ5
1223758428104839169 2020-02-01 19:02:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The two most important things I do as a Member of Congress are vote on matters of war and peace and nominate young people for service academies. These young patriots are the very best our district has to offer. Congratulations! (@weartv)  https://t.co/LlZcNSFMKQ
1223744835397570561 2020-02-01 18:07:59 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> TONIGHT: I'll be on @WattersWorld with @JesseBWatters to discuss the latest on the impeachment trial in the Senate. TUNE IN to @FoxNews at 8:05pm ET/7:05pm CT!
1223724957332471810 2020-02-01 16:49:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> No new evidence.   No new information.   Just more of the same falsehoods from House Democrats who have a bloodlust for impeachment.  https://t.co/881iBsavVd
1223674374064001024 2020-02-01 13:28:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump is presiding over a political movement.  In real America, we see him making changes that will directly impact our lives:  ‚úÖNegotiating better trade deals  ‚úÖStanding up to China  ‚úÖEnding forever wars  This is what an America First agenda looks like.  https://t.co/fgmtZPXCfO
1223629579031441415 2020-02-01 10:30:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> .@donlemon is not a journalist. He is a hack.  The Left and the mainstream media have contempt not just for President Trump, not just for his allies in Congress, but also for the American people who support President @realDonaldTrump.  https://t.co/juaMFgIFw6
1223281032612343808 2020-01-31 11:25:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> If we have a witness exchange program, there is no way we‚Äôre going to get the witnesses we really want but the Democrats will get the witnesses they really want.  https://t.co/GBGnG0aPHW
1223253350185041924 2020-01-31 09:35:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> President @realDonaldTrump uses tough engagement when necessary but has a realistic view of the world where we‚Äôre not going to hand the 21st century over to China by overexerting our military.   We‚Äôre going to be smarter and we‚Äôre going to be better for our country.  https://t.co/3G2Rdceel2
1223014308222771202 2020-01-30 17:45:08 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The results are overwhelming on this question everywhere but inside the DC Beltway.   If we applied the trillions we‚Äôve spent in Iraq to our own border, it would be more secure than a Las Vegas casino.
1223002585893941248 2020-01-30 16:58:33 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Which border should we care more about securing?
1222989109515497491 2020-01-30 16:05:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> .@RepAdamSchiff has been proven a liar time and time again.  https://t.co/fD3bfMEmf7
1222975192235986944 2020-01-30 15:09:42 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The Democrats are not preserving justice with their end-run around our legal system.   If anything, it is they who are abusing their power of impeachment simply because of their impatience. @RandPaul    https://t.co/W5XzyqnRS7
1222965202687315971 2020-01-30 14:30:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Democrats have to manufacture a new ‚Äúbombshell‚Äù every day because they don‚Äôt have a compelling case for impeachment before the American people.  https://t.co/2ksgMWxq4e
1222949598446026752 2020-01-30 13:28:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I think John Bolton got his feelings hurt.  https://t.co/tjshRDRnJQ
1222928786242576384 2020-01-30 12:05:18 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I come to vote my heart.  Instead of sending our soldiers to blood-stained sands of the Middle East, let's care for veterans here at home.  Instead of ill-fated adventurism, let's put America first.  The best time to vote against the Iraq War was 2002. The second best is today.  https://t.co/x7ajvjZGl5
1222919904082292741 2020-01-30 11:30:00 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The foreign policy successes of President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs administration have largely occurred despite @AmbJohnBolton's advice, not because of it.  https://t.co/mTtyltDP72
1222898609726746625 2020-01-30 10:05:23 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I find it suspicious that John Bolton is just now wanting to make a grand entrance into the impeachment trial after sitting totally quiet during the entire House investigation.  I hope our Senators move us past this national impeachment nightmare.  https://t.co/pbfiJIk00d
1222676774712225794 2020-01-29 19:23:53 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> TONIGHT: I'll be on @seanhannity to talk about the latest on the Senate impeachment trial and the Democrats' lies about President @realDonaldTrump. TUNE IN to @FoxNews at 9:25pm ET/8:25pm CT
1222615849757966336 2020-01-29 15:21:48 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> ‚ÄúYou may loathe populism. But I tell you a funny thing ‚Äì it's becoming very popular.‚Äù - @Nigel_Farage  https://t.co/kv9YuGeOO6
1222598991550001152 2020-01-29 14:14:49 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Saddam Hussein died in 2006.   The Authorization to Use Military Force against Saddam's Iraq should be repealed.  If we can't claim victory now, what war is ever winnable?  https://t.co/xAF19D1TOP
1222540916885467136 2020-01-29 10:24:02 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> While Democrats wage war against prosperity, President @realDonaldTrump is presiding over a blue-collar boom in our country.   We are seeing wealth accumulated and wages rising faster for people who have blue-collar jobs.  https://t.co/jqJd0aHChP
1222295802116300800 2020-01-28 18:10:03 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> TONIGHT: I'll be on @trish_regan to talk about the latest on impeachment and President @realDonaldTrump's WINNING economy. TUNE IN to @FoxBusiness at 8:00pm ET/7:00pm CT
1222263903985524736 2020-01-28 16:03:17 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Congress is not living up to the patriotism of our servicemembers who go downrange and fight.  Dems are attaching war powers language to a COMMEMORATIVE COIN bill instead of allowing for a fair &amp; honest debate.  That is NOT how Congress should address military force authorization  https://t.co/IF0uK80nEl
1222244481531043842 2020-01-28 14:46:07 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> All of the "evidence" against President @realDonaldTrump can be categorized as one of three things:   1. Hearsay 2. Speculation and presumption 3. A policy disagreement  None of these things are impeachable.  https://t.co/hyN1FBSqQi
1222180110901678080 2020-01-28 10:30:20 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Mayor Randall Wise was a devoted public servant and a fixture in our Northwest Florida community. His commitment to the people of Niceville was exemplified by his numerous tenures of service as mayor and by his compassion and devotion to those around him.  https://t.co/TTBshJnmY4
1222171149666324481 2020-01-28 09:54:43 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> .@RepAdamSchiff lied when he misrepresented the Ukraine call transcript.  He lied when he said there was more than circumstantial evidence on the Russia probe.   He's been lying for days on the floor of the United States Senate.  Can we at least remove him from the Gang of Eight?  https://t.co/ZAxLH3yCfa
1221963126020755457 2020-01-27 20:08:06 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> TONIGHT: I'll be on @IngrahamAngle with @RepAndyBiggsAZ and @DevinNunes to discuss the latest on the impeachment trial in the Senate. TUNE IN to @FoxNews at 10:25pm ET/9:25pm CT
1221866634811449344 2020-01-27 13:44:41 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> We need a little less Atticus Finch and a little more Miss Universe. #ImpeachmentTrial  https://t.co/hQyOLWiU6f
1221828542775857153 2020-01-27 11:13:19 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> No human being is ever in a more hyperbolic state than when they‚Äôre pitching a book deal.   John Bolton isn‚Äôt negotiating testimony, he‚Äôs negotiating the size of his advance.  https://t.co/FyiLvqYBgm
1221821303969198081 2020-01-27 10:44:33 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember the six million Jews and countless others murdered at the hands of pure evil, and we vow to never forget them.   May their memory be a blessing. #NeverAgain  https://t.co/GVihJO0ZYp

1220796449576931330 2020-01-24 14:52:09 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I'm proud to have an "A" rating on @SBAList‚Äôs National Pro-Life Scorecard! I‚Äôll always stand for the unborn and for life. #MarchForLife  https://t.co/GkraHFGRrW
1220771902626635777 2020-01-24 13:14:37 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Wednesday: @Twitter censors our pro-life video as "sensitive content."  Today: @Twitter censors ANOTHER pro-life video our office created AND censors @TeamTrump's pro-life video.  This is unacceptable. We need answers.  https://t.co/GD1kGabFhe
1220761458448961541 2020-01-24 12:33:07 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Unsolicited advice to the Defense Team: Call an audible, throw a jacket on your most compelling communicator - and #PutInJordan! (3/3)
1220761457555537921 2020-01-24 12:33:06 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> While factually flawed and full of holes, House Managers *did* create ostensibly compelling moments, clips and memes.   @POTUS deserves the very best defense against this impeachment-via hearsay, conjecture and policy disagreement. (2/3)
1220761456779702273 2020-01-24 12:33:06 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The great irony is that while @RepAdamSchiff falsely accuses @realDonaldTrump of undermining elections with legitimate, long-held concerns about Ukraine, foreign aid, and corruption, he is the one prosecuting this #shamimpeachment to pollute the 2020 election. (1/3)
1220756276600242183 2020-01-24 12:12:31 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> I believe it is up to us to give a voice to the unborn.  It is up to us to speak out and demand change.   It is up to us to end abortion once and for all.   #WhyWeMarch #MarchForLife  https://t.co/CHyIZpB2Q2
1220724808519909376 2020-01-24 10:07:28 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> One of our brave Northwest Florida patriots, Rick A. DeMorgan Jr., passed away this week while fighting devastating wildfires in Australia.   Rick‚Äôs servant‚Äôs heart will not soon be forgotten. Our whole community grieves the loss of this hero.    https://t.co/UEQAmXylOD
1220433239002746881 2020-01-23 14:48:53 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Northwest Florida is recovering from this devastating hurricane with the help of Florida‚Äôs tremendous First Family. Thank you @FLCaseyDeSantis and @GovRonDeSantis for standing with Northwest Floridians!
1220354262443724800 2020-01-23 09:35:03 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Florida‚Äôs citizens deserve the benefits of E-Verify: higher wages, increased job security, and a safe, legal workforce.   https://t.co/0J5Xzu6iC2
1220130264728375296 2020-01-22 18:44:58 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> This is what censorship of #ProLife conservatives looks like.   We WILL NOT be silenced.   https://t.co/c57nglckxw
1220040782029250567 2020-01-22 12:49:24 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Twitter flagged our #prolife video on the anniversary of #RoevWade as "potentially sensitive content" and blocked it from auto-play.   We won't be silenced.  WATCH and SHARE to spread the truth about #abortion.
1220015907621175297 2020-01-22 11:10:33 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> America is not just an idea, or documents, or even values.   America is our home. And we must protect our home.   We must protect the water, the air, the creatures, the land and its borders.   We cannot allow the majesty of America to be overrun on our watch.  #AmericaFirst
1220007962653143040 2020-01-22 10:38:59 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> Our inalienable rights as humans begin in the womb.   They are not altered by a flawed court decision like #RoevWade, and our intrinsic value is not dependent upon public opinion.   Every heartbeat has a purpose ‚Äì and we choose to acknowledge it.  We choose life.  https://t.co/M0fkItXYtz

1218252879754153984 2020-01-17 14:24:55 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> As Dems signed the sham articles of impeachment, @potus was signing phase 1 of the China deal thats going to reset the world economy in favor of the American worker.   We'll be stronger because of this trade deal. Dems, through impeachment, are trying to make our country weaker.  https://t.co/I8htzOpRy9
1218211049373151244 2020-01-17 11:38:42 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> As impeachment moves to the Senate and we look at witnesses, one witness I still want to see is @repadamschiff.   Even before the motion to dismiss, there should be a motion to disqualify Schiff as an impeachment manager because he is a fact witness to the set up.

1215023368203898880 2020-01-08 16:31:59 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The violence that Iran has undertaken has been animated by the Iran deal. We are in this circumstance because of the failures of the Obama-Biden policy.   https://t.co/WQe8yTLia1
1215001407847325698 2020-01-08 15:04:43 -0400 <RepMattGaetz> The only quid pro quo I observed in this impeachment was on the House Floor.
