1393540236727177216 2021-05-15 08:14:17 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> This is UNBELIEVABLE.  In case you had any question as to where President Biden stands on police, now you know...
1392651666994999304 2021-05-12 21:23:26 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> On Liz Cheney - I've seen a lot of "This is a circular firing squad, dooming the GOP."  For those in the real world, it's plainly obvious that not a single person outside the Swamp is talking about Cheney.  Gas prices, job openings, inflation, Israel &amp; CRISES are the focus.
1391923454312595460 2021-05-10 21:09:46 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Romney says: "Expelling Liz Cheney will drive away voters"  This just simply isn't the case.   Republican leadership should reflect Republican voters. Straying from that concept will UNDOUBTEDLY hemorrhage Republican voters.  Exact opposite of Romney's statement is true.
1391456855730294797 2021-05-09 14:15:41 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Happy Mother‚Äôs Day to all! üíê  https://t.co/MnPnVGkkhi

Other countries open their schools. Many Dem cities in America do not. Children suffer. That is a fact -- SCIENCE that Democrats would rather bury.

1379532383343554562 2021-04-06 16:32:05 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> It‚Äôs been a revealing few days for CBS!  1Ô∏è‚É£ they called for ‚Äúfight‚Äù against GA election law before deleting the tweet  2Ô∏è‚É£ they gave softball Hunter interview, never pressing him on why a laptop w/ thousands of pics of him ‚Äúmight‚Äù be his  3Ô∏è‚É£ @60Minutes DeSantis hit job  NOT good!
1379525111481573377 2021-04-06 16:03:11 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Americans are not dumb.

1379080429702164482 2021-04-05 10:36:11 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Unsurprisingly, a left-wing activist at @60Minutes dishonestly peddled conspiracy theories about @GovRonDeSantis' COVID response. @MZHemingway exposes the total and complete hit job below ‚¨áÔ∏è  https://t.co/WRtRqkbsGv

1376701867233792002 2021-03-29 21:04:37 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> The Democrat push for federalizing elections combined with their complete mistruths about Georgia‚Äôs voting law tell you all you need to know: For Democrats, it‚Äôs about power at any cost!  Coming up with @seanhannity on @FoxNews at 9:10 PM ET!
1375196921887875072 2021-03-25 17:24:30 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Bravo to the Blue Checks who fact check my typo and not President Biden taking credit for what he inherited thanks to Operation Warp Speed!
1375182343359578119 2021-03-25 16:26:34 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> ‚ÄúBiden's first press conference leaves Americans with many more questions than answers‚Äù    My op-Ed ‚¨áÔ∏è  https://t.co/uFaHjoEmZB
1375169717107879939 2021-03-25 15:36:24 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Brilliant points from my former colleague @StephenM ‚¨áÔ∏è
1375145622156771332 2021-03-25 14:00:39 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Excellent questions from @kwelkernbc on transparency in migrant facilities and on whether President Biden rolled back President Trump's immigration policies too quickly.
1375145080521117697 2021-03-25 13:58:30 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Asked about whether journalists will have access to migrant facilities, Biden says only when...  "his plan is underway"  "when he can implement what they're doing right now"  Those are confusing and unacceptable answers.
1375142714707218437 2021-03-25 13:49:06 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Very good question just now on immigration.  Reporter confronts President Biden with the words of a migrant saying she came because of President Biden, contradicting his claim that he is not the reason for the crisis.
1375140392946049028 2021-03-25 13:39:53 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Biden repeats the White House line that the "VAST MAJORITY" of migrants are being sent back.   The follow up question should be this Axios report saying only 13% of families are being denied entry.  https://t.co/ruuNwRg5Yh
1375139899066740748 2021-03-25 13:37:55 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> This entire diatribe on immigration from President Biden should be fact-checked as "FALSE" by any honest fact checker.  Biden claims migrants are not coming because of him when they are ON CAMERA saying they are and wearing Biden T-shirts, displaying Biden flags!
1375139364783714304 2021-03-25 13:35:48 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> President Biden blames Republicans for "politics of division" -- this from the man who called for unity, met with Republicans on COVID relief, and then steamrolled them, moving unilaterally with only Democrat votes.
1375138423623843841 2021-03-25 13:32:03 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> President Biden begins his first press conference by touting the rate of vaccines being administered, a feet solely made possible by President Trump's Operation Warp Speed.
1375137986283704325 2021-03-25 13:30:19 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Right out of the gate, the White House press corps stands for President Biden.   Would have been nice if they would have routinely shown that level of respect for President Trump.  I hope this is not indicative of softball questions to come!
1375086219944673288 2021-03-25 10:04:37 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> It is incumbent on the White House press corps to ask President Biden difficult questions today.  In the Trump era, a handful of reporters did not ask questions; they debated him. What will they do today?  Discussing on @FoxNews w/ @GillianHTurner during the @FaulknerFocus at 11!
1375045833347989507 2021-03-25 07:24:08 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Today, President Biden comes out of hiding and will give his first press conference. He has set a 100-year record in delaying this until just now.  Coming up on Fox &amp; Friends, @FoxNews at 8 AM ET to discuss this and more!
1374775951683379207 2021-03-24 13:31:43 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> The White House has said repeatedly that the "VAST MAJORITY" of families are being turned away  According to Axios, only 13% are being turned away &amp; the other 87% being released into US for proceedings  13% is NOT the vast majority!  On @marthamaccallum , @FoxNews to discuss at 3
1374511091963678723 2021-03-23 19:59:16 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Tonight we celebrated an amazing life. He went from childhood orthodontist to a friend later in life.

1374164429579948032 2021-03-22 21:01:45 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> More unaccompanied minors have already been detained in March than in all of February, according to CNN.  This is a disaster ‚Äî a CRISIS ‚Äî and it‚Äôs getting worse.  Joining @seanhannity to discuss at 9:05 PM ET!
1374114936444616713 2021-03-22 17:45:05 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Please pray for the family of Eric Spinato. This is a sad and tragic loss for the Fox family. I worked with Eric after college, and he was wonderful. Sending prayers. üôèüèª  https://t.co/T7DwES90qT
1374045057746137090 2021-03-22 13:07:24 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> It is pure absurdity for the Biden administration to blame a surge of migrants (many in Biden T-shirts &amp; some who have said on camera that they are coming because of Biden) on Trump. No one is buying it!  Coming on @FoxNews @AmericaRpts w/ @SandraSmithFox &amp; @johnrobertsFox at 2!

1314019200101502976 2020-10-07 21:46:05 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Kamala Harris SPONSORED the Green New Deal.   Joe Biden FEATURES the Green New Deal on his campaign website.   Democrats will RAISE your taxes, ELIMINATE fracking, DESTROY the economy.   #VPDebate
1314018134681157632 2020-10-07 21:41:51 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Joe Biden has SAID he will ban fracking. There is no deceiving us, Kamala!   #VPDebate

1314012907378745344 2020-10-07 21:21:04 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Unbelievable.

1314010380516167680 2020-10-07 21:11:02 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Right out of the gate, Kamala Harris FAILS to say what she would do differently than President @realDonaldTrump in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

1296263315354681345 2020-08-19 21:50:32 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Right off the bat, Crooked Hillary mentions the so-called Biden ‚ÄúPandemic Playbook‚Äù supposedly left for @realDonaldTrump.  I‚Äôve read the playbook, which mentions the China-led WHO dozens of times.  Rely on China is NOT a strategy, no matter what CROOKED and SLEEPY say!

1295900353066684417 2020-08-18 21:48:15 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> It appears the Democrats quit in the 1st Quarter.  Night 1 of the DNC featured music videos with empty rhetoric and no solutions.

1260380634989674496 2020-05-12 21:25:34 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> At Harvard Law School, I was heartbroken when Ravi‚Äôs protege, @NAQureshi, passed away of stomach cancer at the age of 34.  Nabeel also changed countless lives.  My heart sunk when I read that Ravi, too, had cancer.
1260380629503545346 2020-05-12 21:25:33 -0400 <kayleighmcenany> Ravi lays an intellectual foundation where the mind can move to a place that only the heart can ultimately  find in the person of Jesus Christ.  Countless lives are changed because of Ravi, including my own.
