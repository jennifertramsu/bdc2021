1349525096763801600 2021-01-13 20:13:50 -0400 <DennisPrager> I’ve thought about the big subjects since the age of thirteen. Is there a God? Is there an afterlife? Why do good people suffer?

1320408710817042432 2020-10-25 12:55:43 -0400 <DennisPrager> What did World Opinion do for six million Jews? For a million and half Armenians I? For 60 million Chinese under Mao? Six million Ukrainians under Stalin? For the Tutsis slaughtered by the Hutus in Rwanda?  Nothing.
1320408656869945345 2020-10-25 12:55:30 -0400 <DennisPrager> The elites, i.e., the left, always speaks of the importance of World Opinion.

1255193289092784131 2020-04-28 13:52:55 -0400 <DennisPrager> I'll be joining @seanspicer on his show Spicer &amp; Co. on NewsmaxTV today to discuss the impact of the coronavirus on college and the dress rehearsal for a police state we're all playing parts in.  https://t.co/emYTI2Zvnw
1250142066429923328 2020-04-14 15:21:09 -0400 <DennisPrager> Act quickly. The extended rental buys you unlimited viewing until May 31st!    https://t.co/C8ANLe2gpD
1248405050419863552 2020-04-09 20:18:52 -0400 <DennisPrager> Given China's moral record under the CCP even before its irresponsible attempt to cover up the outbreak and lying about how the virus spreads, this is long overdue. Other countries, including America, should be following Japan's lead.   https://t.co/jnrnQ2Ppti
1248403246495891456 2020-04-09 20:11:42 -0400 <DennisPrager> For of you who missed it, because of the current circumstances in which so many are shut in and alone, I conducted the Passover Seder online last night, which was the first night of Passover. Whatever your background, I think you will find it meaningful.  https://t.co/AxVub0bR0Z
1248401046042333195 2020-04-09 20:02:58 -0400 <DennisPrager> Thought I'd share some bitter humor.  https://t.co/ilZHOx81en
1244684519753408517 2020-03-30 13:54:49 -0400 <DennisPrager> Need something to watch while you stay home?
1240795143587819521 2020-03-19 20:19:49 -0400 <DennisPrager> People should know about the Asian “wet markets,” the source of the coronavirus. Western govts should be exerting pressure on Asian govts to shut them down.This beautifully-written article explains why they're both immoral &amp; a threat to the entire world.   https://t.co/Ov9ID60jmw
1225683165689155584 2020-02-07 02:30:13 -0400 <DennisPrager> Why isn't one mainstream news source other than Fox reporting on this?    https://t.co/99IjAEKZ1J
1225229517012140033 2020-02-05 20:27:35 -0400 <DennisPrager> This is a very intelligent take.
1221636398106628096 2020-01-26 22:29:48 -0400 <DennisPrager> Watch this video about a young Israeli Christian woman in the Israeli army. If you are as moved as I was, consider sending it to others.   https://t.co/BK5Y8OuKag
1213174957641011200 2020-01-03 14:07:04 -0400 <DennisPrager> When a barbaric regime thinks a democracy will do nothing, the barbaric regime will do anything.
