1397363021652037633 2021-05-25 21:24:40 -0400 <tedcruz> Congratulations @Liz_Wheeler on the launch of your new podcast!   https://t.co/U8vVIn9ia1
1397291859458859020 2021-05-25 16:41:54 -0400 <tedcruz> Let me tell you about something we like to call the SCRIPT Act.  https://t.co/XMMDaKW1g5
1397249560230207493 2021-05-25 13:53:49 -0400 <tedcruz> In addition to pressuring our Israeli allies diplomatically, the Biden administration will also be funding Hamas rockets. And that's just what they're admitting to.  https://t.co/S9QGkbSpeu
1397232358387032069 2021-05-25 12:45:28 -0400 <tedcruz> Wonder if Putin will arrive with birthday cake to accompany the multi-billion dollar present that Biden gave him by waiving sanctions against Nord Stream 2.
1397194608074006530 2021-05-25 10:15:27 -0400 <tedcruz> An enterprising reporter should ask The White House if pumping the brakes on Nord Stream 2 sanctions was a precondition for this meeting.
1397180551589728260 2021-05-25 09:19:36 -0400 <tedcruz> Clowns. 🤡🤡🤡🤡  https://t.co/hpDEyxrdm2
1397167171978080259 2021-05-25 08:26:26 -0400 <tedcruz> Yep.
1397051036506939401 2021-05-25 00:44:57 -0400 <tedcruz> .@JimmyKimmelLive keeps talking crap. Really tough guy.  Here’s a reminder, when we played one-on-one, I kicked his ass. He has to live with that...forever.  Rematch, punk?   https://t.co/t8O0QCEaYS
1397047111145988099 2021-05-25 00:29:21 -0400 <tedcruz> Dave, because Biden is following Bernie’s policies on...everything.   The missiles Hamas was firing at Israel...likely paid for by the over $100mm the Biden admin (illegally) sent to the Palestinian Authority.
1397021885246943232 2021-05-24 22:49:07 -0400 <tedcruz> THREE times as many IRS agents. And your bank, deputized by the government to spy on you.  What could possibly go wrong?  https://t.co/VGz40ONNfy
1397020964639100929 2021-05-24 22:45:28 -0400 <tedcruz> Utterly absurd.  Antisemitism is always, always wrong, whether from Left or Right.  Why do liberals find that hard to say?
1397011319757361157 2021-05-24 22:07:08 -0400 <tedcruz> Democrats have to make this decision:   Do they stand with Israel?   Or   Do they stand with Hamas terrorists?  https://t.co/E8x7ra2nQ7
1396996940286550022 2021-05-24 21:10:00 -0400 <tedcruz> yes

1396996561180188677 2021-05-24 21:08:29 -0400 <tedcruz> Will @ADL hold Bernie &amp; Biden to account?
1396995156512059394 2021-05-24 21:02:54 -0400 <tedcruz> “National Surrogate” for @SenSanders is honest, at least.   He demands that the Left “STOP condemning antisemitism.”  That’s what he believes.   Do you?    Does Bernie?    Does Biden?  Does Kamala?  They should tell us.
1396904991085010951 2021-05-24 15:04:37 -0400 <tedcruz> Um, the WHO is in effect a wholly owned subsidiary of the CCP.  If you’re “hopeful” about their “investigation,” then you’re hoping for its inevitable conclusion:  that China is totally innocent &amp; don’t believe your lying eyes.
1396883881689763849 2021-05-24 13:40:44 -0400 <tedcruz> For the past year, the media pushed the narrative that COVID leaking from a Chinese lab was “fringe” and “debunked.”  But if you listened to my April 2020 episode of #Verdict, this news doesn’t surprise you.  https://t.co/uYW9ZVKSge  https://t.co/YV0EjeDlbw
1396831374695337986 2021-05-24 10:12:06 -0400 <tedcruz> This is NOT a military recruiting video.  https://t.co/R2TpUheJjE
1396685132904423432 2021-05-24 00:30:59 -0400 <tedcruz> WaPo recognizing—unironically—that the founders of Black Lives Matter were racist anti-Semites, avowed Marxists, virulently anti-Israel &amp; vocal supporters of Hamas terrorists.  This “changed the Democratic Party,” they dryly observe.  No kidding.  https://t.co/0FO6c3JrOO
1396631663212441600 2021-05-23 20:58:31 -0400 <tedcruz> wow

1396557588670689289 2021-05-23 16:04:10 -0400 <tedcruz> And for those who disingenuously claim the point is about gender, here’s another powerful recruiting ad:  https://t.co/MOzfDxxSTQ

1396556307914756096 2021-05-23 15:59:05 -0400 <tedcruz> This is another.  https://t.co/ypCDXIYNwC

1396555066245582852 2021-05-23 15:54:09 -0400 <tedcruz> Perusing the comments, it’s really sad to see how many Leftists are unabashed anti-Semites who hate &amp; despise Israel.
1396543493720399873 2021-05-23 15:08:10 -0400 <tedcruz> “Subtle”  Supporting Israel —&gt; undermining Israel.  Fighting Hamas —&gt; funding Hamas  Peace —&gt; War  I’d hate to see “unsubtle.”  https://t.co/Jycm9ZpyZJ
1396539150967443469 2021-05-23 14:50:54 -0400 <tedcruz> Pure artistry.
1396532235835219969 2021-05-23 14:23:25 -0400 <tedcruz> Good Q.
1396531510312906760 2021-05-23 14:20:33 -0400 <tedcruz> No doubt.
1396531088856653832 2021-05-23 14:18:52 -0400 <tedcruz> Legend.
1396448927180894208 2021-05-23 08:52:23 -0400 <tedcruz> I’m introducing a resolution to approve the arms sale to Israel.  Now Democrats have to decide: Do they stand with our friend and ally Israel, or are they going to sashay up to the anti-Israel Left?  https://t.co/vtyOWZzhCd
1396137826446622722 2021-05-22 12:16:11 -0400 <tedcruz> Yes, Colonel Vladimir Putin of the KGB is—and always has been—a communist.  Most brutal left-wing dictators are.  That’s why you defend them.
1396131148850466819 2021-05-22 11:49:39 -0400 <tedcruz> I’m the one on the right.  https://t.co/wm9XTAb8r0
1396128832604852225 2021-05-22 11:40:27 -0400 <tedcruz> You have no recollection of years 6-10 of your life?  What the heck did you do as a kid?
1396110606357434372 2021-05-22 10:28:01 -0400 <tedcruz> “it shouldn’t be lost on us that not only does the Nord Stream 2 enrich &amp; strengthen Putin’s hold on power, also, it’s in direct contradiction to Biden’s stated claim that the ‘climate crisis’ is now a major factor in his administration’s foreign policy”   https://t.co/dL4ne1GyJE
1396108765590691840 2021-05-22 10:20:42 -0400 <tedcruz> The Biden energy plan.  https://t.co/Rn9ELcMlec
1395960427553693699 2021-05-22 00:31:16 -0400 <tedcruz> 🤷🏻‍♂️
1395916321326522370 2021-05-21 21:36:00 -0400 <tedcruz> 6/x Cover that, Brian.  But that would be actual news, something you don’t do.  Use your condescending wit to call Biden “Kremlin Joe”—he’s the one illegally giving billions to Putin.  But your corporate overlords wouldn’t let you.  Congrats, Brian. You are Pravda.
1395915698895998982 2021-05-21 21:33:32 -0400 <tedcruz> 5/x And (3) JUST THIS WEEK Biden gave Putin a multi-billion-dollar gift, when he waived mandatory U.S. sanctions to allow Russia to build Nord Stream 2, a massive natural gas pipeline to Germany.  Who authored the sanctions that STOPPED NS2? That would be me.
1395914884681019395 2021-05-21 21:30:18 -0400 <tedcruz> 4/x (2) I was arguing that our military needs to be able to kick the ass of Russian soldiers.  It’s Brian &amp; his lefty comrades that are working relentlessly to diminish the effectiveness of the U.S. military—the finest fighting force on the face of the planet.
1395914190141935616 2021-05-21 21:27:32 -0400 <tedcruz> 3/x Now, with his trademark ignorant snark, he’s dubbed me “Kremlin Cruz.”  Three problems:  (1) I hate communists, my family was imprisoned &amp; tortured by communists, and Brian is a shameless apologist for Russian (and Chinese and Cuban) communists.
1395911036578971649 2021-05-21 21:15:00 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x Now, he’s throwing a hissy fit that I criticized the ridiculously woke video that the Biden admin put out.  Williams accidentally told the truth, when he describes it as “a video meant to diminish the U.S. military.”  TRUE. That’s the problem. (The Pentagon put it out.)
1395909624373682177 2021-05-21 21:09:23 -0400 <tedcruz> 1/x Is there a more pitiful example of corrupt corporate media than Brian Williams?  He was fired as the anchor of NBC Nightly News for "misrepresenting events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003.” Now, he’s a left-wing hack at MSNBC.  https://t.co/0lGt3noUbQ
1395887945480036361 2021-05-21 19:43:15 -0400 <tedcruz> Powerful. Am very impressed with the great work Texas-based @OthramTech is doing—innovative DNA technology that is helping solve cold cases across the country and bringing rapists &amp; murderers to justice.
1395884106932801536 2021-05-21 19:28:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Wow.  A good friend of mine in CA sent me the video below. What a powerful, moving indictment of the failed policies in Venice Beach producing poverty, drug addiction, homelessness, public defecation &amp; rampant violence.  This is WRONG. We can do better.   https://t.co/wimy6lesqB
1395841473665458179 2021-05-21 16:38:35 -0400 <tedcruz> Hamas terrorists have fired 4,000 rockets at Israel, targeting innocent civilians.  I stand with Israel. Israel is a sovereign nation seeking to defend itself against terrorists.  https://t.co/oVC12ZvRX3
1395793999257030662 2021-05-21 13:29:56 -0400 <tedcruz> 😂😂😂  https://t.co/m50tV6FcMC
1395783183472418818 2021-05-21 12:46:57 -0400 <tedcruz> Very good Q.
1395776714018525193 2021-05-21 12:21:15 -0400 <tedcruz> I never thought we would see this: Democrat members of Congress acting as the press secretaries for Hamas terrorists.  https://t.co/g4QlfZyWhk
1395586598943825924 2021-05-20 23:45:48 -0400 <tedcruz> I’m enjoying lefty blue checkmarks losing their minds over this tweet, dishonestly claiming that I’m “attacking the military.”  Uh, no. We have the greatest military on earth, but Dem politicians &amp; woke media are trying to turn them into pansies.  The new Dem videos are terrible.
1395584181585989637 2021-05-20 23:36:12 -0400 <tedcruz> This is asinine.   Pelosi is abusing her power, arbitrarily &amp; irrationally.  She is trying to fine House Members for FOLLOWING the CDC GUIDANCE.  BTW, in the Senate almost all of us (including Dems) have listened to CDC &amp; removed our masks.  #FollowTheScience
1395577618133618690 2021-05-20 23:10:07 -0400 <tedcruz> Good news.   Commenters have said they removed it intact &amp; are transporting it to the National Constitution Center in Philly.   I didn’t know that — just saw it was gone — and am very glad to hear it!
1395466833227038726 2021-05-20 15:49:54 -0400 <tedcruz> Depressing.  They just jack-hammered the text of the First Amendment off the wall in front of what used to be the Newseum in DC.   I hope that’s not foreshadowing what’s to come over the next four years....  https://t.co/JViclELcvd
1395460093903261699 2021-05-20 15:23:07 -0400 <tedcruz> Yes. Yes, there is.
1395422163805609984 2021-05-20 12:52:24 -0400 <tedcruz> The far left despises Israel’s right to exist.  Don’t miss the all new episode of #Verdict where @michaeljknowles and I discuss why so many Democrats are openly supporting America’s and Israel’s enemies.  Watch the full episode on YouTube:  https://t.co/Tb9tkXbd0J  https://t.co/NaSGJJviHD
1395402873291300865 2021-05-20 11:35:44 -0400 <tedcruz> The rockets, missiles, and drones being launched at Israeli civilians all come from Iran.   The terrorists launching them are paid by Iran.   And Joe Biden is rushing to give Iran hundreds of billions of dollars.  Why?
1395399000702980102 2021-05-20 11:20:21 -0400 <tedcruz> What does Putin have on Biden?
1395398411743113217 2021-05-20 11:18:01 -0400 <tedcruz> that’s gonna leave a mark
1395394343268126722 2021-05-20 11:01:51 -0400 <tedcruz> yep
1395394254969753601 2021-05-20 11:01:30 -0400 <tedcruz> Holy crap.  Perhaps a woke, emasculated military is not the best idea....
1395391991521943567 2021-05-20 10:52:30 -0400 <tedcruz> Powerful.   Important read on the facts as to what’s happening in Israel &amp; the mendacity of the press and the Dems who are defending Hamas terrorists.  https://t.co/yTo3WflOs9
1395387082986737673 2021-05-20 10:33:00 -0400 <tedcruz> It doesn’t make any sense why Joe Biden is crawling into bed with Putin and Russia.    Biden decided pipelines &amp; jobs in America are bad while pipelines &amp; jobs in Russia are good.  https://t.co/JADac5w32y
1395373644537290759 2021-05-20 09:39:36 -0400 <tedcruz> Indeed.
1395355373846941698 2021-05-20 08:27:00 -0400 <tedcruz> There’s a border crisis, a gas crisis, we're on the verge of an inflation crisis, and there’s war in the Middle East.   Biden’s first 4 months in office are a reprise of the 1970s: Biden is Jimmy Carter 2.0 and Kamala Harris is Walter Mondale.  https://t.co/pKfngq71PW
1395202976566890507 2021-05-19 22:21:25 -0400 <tedcruz> Hamas terrorists have fired over 4,000 rockets into Israel.   Every one of those rockets might as well have Joe Biden's name written on it because it is his lack of backbone to stand with Israel that is causing this war.  https://t.co/nEttTNJWTf
1395193023013740550 2021-05-19 21:41:52 -0400 <tedcruz> yep
1395090324985364481 2021-05-19 14:53:47 -0400 <tedcruz> No actual Latino uses the woke made-up term “Latinx.”
1395089704014524416 2021-05-19 14:51:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Overt racism from the mayor of Chicago.
1395075219774230533 2021-05-19 13:53:46 -0400 <tedcruz> It wasn’t me.
1395069571678285830 2021-05-19 13:31:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Good advice.  And be sure to let them know whether you support Israel or Hamas terrorists.
1395068441716043784 2021-05-19 13:26:50 -0400 <tedcruz> Four months in, and Biden has already climbed into bed with Putin.
1395068342327779336 2021-05-19 13:26:26 -0400 <tedcruz> The Squad is gunning for a promotion from press secretaries for Hamas to defense secretaries for Hamas.   https://t.co/fv241QUKTY
1395031264013524997 2021-05-19 10:59:06 -0400 <tedcruz> Putin is loving this.  https://t.co/ry90ha4FwY
1395022635860471809 2021-05-19 10:24:49 -0400 <tedcruz> Joe Biden is trying to pump the brakes on Israel defeating Iran-backed Palestinian terrorists, because of course he is.
1395022337448288268 2021-05-19 10:23:38 -0400 <tedcruz> Hmm. It’s almost like the corporate media has their own political agenda....
1394781170655715331 2021-05-18 18:25:19 -0400 <tedcruz> The Biden administration is committed to denying the gains of the previous administration because otherwise they'd have to admit they're in the process of destroying them.
1394720777996574728 2021-05-18 14:25:20 -0400 <tedcruz> Will the media hold Dems to account for their blatant partisan lies?  I won’t hold my breath....
1394718714998804482 2021-05-18 14:17:08 -0400 <tedcruz> Stunning. In defiance of U.S. law, Biden is actively helping Putin build his pipeline.  Objectively speaking, the Biden administration is shaping up to be the most pro-Russia administration of the modern era.  https://t.co/3FwjiIILEc
1394717507697643524 2021-05-18 14:12:21 -0400 <tedcruz> When you think of the pressing needs of America, Biden’s wanting THOUSANDS MORE IRS agents doesn’t exactly reflect the pulse of our Nation....  #AbolishTheIRS #FlatTax
1394710444179431429 2021-05-18 13:44:17 -0400 <tedcruz> Awesome!
1394701334134284294 2021-05-18 13:08:05 -0400 <tedcruz> This is cultish &amp; weird.  Everybody should choose for themselves.  #FollowTheScience
1394692917390938120 2021-05-18 12:34:38 -0400 <tedcruz> No kidding.
1394671621412110338 2021-05-18 11:10:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Yes, the LA Times is just going to gloss over the fact that Hamas terrorists are launching rockets at Israel and using civilians as human shields.  Israel unequivocally has the right and obligation to defend itself.
1394666742161584132 2021-05-18 10:50:37 -0400 <tedcruz> Puppet-masters must be obeyed.
1394507975130238978 2021-05-18 00:19:44 -0400 <tedcruz> Bravo!
1394507691561730049 2021-05-18 00:18:37 -0400 <tedcruz> @JohnypPublic Corruption is not capitalism.
1394507436434890754 2021-05-18 00:17:36 -0400 <tedcruz> Wait till he finds out what’s in the Second Amendment....  https://t.co/j50WdwZJQa
1394505607303024640 2021-05-18 00:10:20 -0400 <tedcruz> Wow.  He’s sold 50,000 books; that works out to $102 per book.  Did they pay him in a brown paper sack, in unmarked bills?
1394504123672940546 2021-05-18 00:04:26 -0400 <tedcruz> Of course.  “Jewish lives matter too. And Hamas terrorists shouldn’t kill them.”  Can you say that also?
1394498448947306498 2021-05-17 23:41:53 -0400 <tedcruz> yep

1394310313294585858 2021-05-17 11:14:18 -0400 <tedcruz> As a democracy, Israel also has an extra burden to protect its citizens from the Iran-backed terrorists who are trying to indiscriminately murder them.
1394282489460441089 2021-05-17 09:23:44 -0400 <tedcruz> exactly right

1394279316305977348 2021-05-17 09:11:08 -0400 <tedcruz> Perhaps they should ratchet down the sanctimonious lectures, given that the rockets raining down on Israeli citizens were likely paid for by U.S. tax dollars that the Biden Admin gave the Palestinian Authority—and Biden wants to give billions more to Iran, which is funding Hamas.

1390363627790770178 2021-05-06 13:51:35 -0400 <tedcruz> Yet again, Joe Biden is aiming to appease the mullas in Iran over and above the security interests of America.  https://t.co/yTAoNJilPi
1390336804130336770 2021-05-06 12:04:59 -0400 <tedcruz> I’m in Danville, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, and Chesterfield, Virginia today campaigning with my friend @GlennYoungkin ahead of the convention on Saturday.  #WinWithGlenn  https://t.co/VZk8bol5Ty  https://t.co/mtRcMqghMm

1390301972885123074 2021-05-06 09:46:35 -0400 <tedcruz> On this National Day of Prayer, I’m reminded of Philippians 4:6.  I lift up all Americans who are hurting &amp; I pray they’d be strengthened.   I pray for renewal for our country &amp; for the first responders, police officers, medical professionals, &amp; soldiers that they’d be protected.
1390111416619831302 2021-05-05 21:09:23 -0400 <tedcruz> Turns out, people don’t like it when woke corporations parrot the radical left’s talking points and drive business out of the state.
1390069161083158529 2021-05-05 18:21:28 -0400 <tedcruz> As extreme as Barack Obama was, Joe Biden has said, “Hold my beer.”  https://t.co/AWi2VRjoE6

1389937682395062273 2021-05-05 09:39:01 -0400 <tedcruz> Disgraceful.   For every liberal celebrating Trump’s social media ban, if the Big Tech oligarchs can muzzle the former President, what’s to stop them from silencing you?
1389907133005717514 2021-05-05 07:37:38 -0400 <tedcruz> From now on, Politi-“fact” will be required to append to every story: “I’m Joe Biden, and I approve this message.”

1389759331470659586 2021-05-04 21:50:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Had a great dinner tonight with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago.   He’s in great spirits! We spent the evening talking about working together to re-take the House &amp; Senate in 2022. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  https://t.co/OdtUBxHGSn

Next, these angry scolds are going to tell me Jack Ryan &amp; James Bond aren’t real either....  My point is that CIA agents should be bad-asses—not woke, fragile flowers needing safe spaces.

1389556940435492865 2021-05-04 08:26:05 -0400 <tedcruz> The NYT story begins:   “The front door of the Hidalgo County Republican Party’s office is covered with photos of high-profile politicians: Gov.

1389402576853082113 2021-05-03 22:12:42 -0400 <tedcruz> This is deranged. And hateful. And racist.  To those who agree with her politics—that of an angry Leftist schoolteacher who hates law enforcement—this video might give you second thoughts.

1389339496131477505 2021-05-03 18:02:03 -0400 <tedcruz> Dems accidentally call for abolishing the income tax for those making under $400k.  I accept!
1389335049414250501 2021-05-03 17:44:23 -0400 <tedcruz> No, your job is not to “uphold a rules-based order” with China.  Your job is to defend America.
1389334236830879745 2021-05-03 17:41:09 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s now beyond satire.   New version: she sleeps forever.
1389333993892495360 2021-05-03 17:40:11 -0400 <tedcruz> Today’s liberalism is angry, intolerant, judgmental &amp; joyless.   Whatever happened to “make love, not war”? ✌️✌️✌️
1389333550009360388 2021-05-03 17:38:25 -0400 <tedcruz> Great news.
1389328457436389376 2021-05-03 17:18:11 -0400 <tedcruz> This is beyond cool.
1389318617804771330 2021-05-03 16:39:05 -0400 <tedcruz> The teachers union bosses are running the show at the CDC.  It’s time for Joe Biden and CDC Director Walensky to stop putting union bosses before our kids.  If the status quo continues, America’s students will only fall further and further behind.  https://t.co/GUiwJF4KdH
1389276975852711940 2021-05-03 13:53:37 -0400 <tedcruz> The national security crisis on our southern border is real and gang members and terrorists are trying to exploit Joe Biden’s open borders. #BidenBorderCrisis     https://t.co/NFFozf78Gq
1389233629587456000 2021-05-03 11:01:22 -0400 <tedcruz> The most important political change of the last decade has been the socioeconomic inversion.   Democrats today are the party of rich coastal elites &amp; Republicans are the party of blue-collar workers.  https://t.co/t3yMxBUh27

1388487117471424512 2021-05-01 09:35:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Joe Biden is taking credit for victories that were won by his predecessor.  He started his presidency with a vaccine that had already been developed and with an economy that was opening up.  https://t.co/h4ZLVbnG0R

1388259264578433027 2021-04-30 18:29:35 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s very hard to be an oppressed, multi-millionaire white liberal tv star.   Nobody understands suffering more.

1387950272346042371 2021-04-29 22:01:46 -0400 <tedcruz> If this transcript is confirmed, John Kerry must resign immediately and if he doesn’t, President Biden must fire him immediately.
1387943787113025546 2021-04-29 21:36:00 -0400 <tedcruz> I’m fed up.

1387906289917779973 2021-04-29 19:07:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Joe Biden’s boring facade is designed to mask what is the most radical package of policy proposals that any president has ever laid out in the first 100 days.   Biden has handed control of the policy agenda to the extreme left: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and AOC.  https://t.co/6ijt4CLz96
1387875336373764097 2021-04-29 17:04:00 -0400 <tedcruz> The Left is intolerant. The Left believes in Cancel Culture and there are a few things that enrage the left more than minorities that don't sit down and shut up and obey.  https://t.co/7WBDt5eR5K

1387765255535833096 2021-04-29 09:46:35 -0400 <tedcruz> true that.
1387757494932590592 2021-04-29 09:15:44 -0400 <tedcruz> As America’s greatest basketball player observed years ago, Republicans buy sneakers, too.   We cast votes, too.

1387615947092111361 2021-04-28 23:53:17 -0400 <tedcruz> The most radical line from Joe Biden was, "We the People is the government."  No Joe, you seriously misunderstand the Constitution. "We the People" is not the government.   "We the People" is the people who are in charge of the government, whose liberty Biden is stripping away.  https://t.co/ztwfzOoBSj

1374930660738146308 2021-03-24 23:46:29 -0400 <tedcruz> Kamala, tomorrow 17 senators are joining me at the TX border.  The Biden admin is refusing to allow press to see the CBP facilities.   Since you’ve promised to “release children from cages,” surely your admin will allow media to film the empty cages.  If not, what are you hiding?

1374839642353233926 2021-03-24 17:44:48 -0400 <tedcruz> If the Biden admin was truly committed to being transparent about the crisis on the border, they would grant media access to the Donna facility.
1374839641128509447 2021-03-24 17:44:48 -0400 <tedcruz> The Biden admin is instead taking a camera to HHS's Carrizo Springs facility which The Washington Post reports has a soccer field, basketball court, and "a legal services trailer has the Spanish word 'Bienvenidos,' or welcome, on a banner on its roof."
1374839639828267011 2021-03-24 17:44:48 -0400 <tedcruz> Reports about the CBP's Donna facility indicate minors are hungry, have only showered once in 7 days, were forced to sleep on the floor, and haven't seen sunlight in days.  Of course the Biden admin isn't allowing cameras in that facility.
1374839638729318401 2021-03-24 17:44:47 -0400 <tedcruz> The White House hand-picked a TV crew to accompany their trip to the Carrizo Springs, NOT the Donna facility.    That’s not transparency.   True transparency would be to open the Donna facility to press that’s at 1,556% capacity when 18 Senators go there Friday.
1374796996540829700 2021-03-24 14:55:21 -0400 <tedcruz> Great to have my friend Governor @ScottWalker join me on the latest episode of #Verdict the talk about @yaf and his new plan, The Long Game.

1374365436188491777 2021-03-23 10:20:29 -0400 <tedcruz> This crisis is the consequence of policy decisions made by the Biden admin.  “Internal CBP documents obtained by ABC News show there are now 3,889 migrants in the Donna facility that is meant to hold just 250.

The Corrupt Politicians Act would result in millions of illegal aliens &amp; criminals voting. That would elect Democrats &amp; steal your right to vote.
1373302635239981058 2021-03-20 11:57:17 -0400 <tedcruz> Yep. And last week Dems sent $1400 taxpayer checks to millions of illegal aliens &amp; criminals (including child molesters) currently in prison.
1373301444233809926 2021-03-20 11:52:33 -0400 <tedcruz> True that.

1371871477688115200 2021-03-16 13:10:23 -0400 <tedcruz> The crisis at the border was fully avoidable and it is getting worse:   More than 100,000 migrants were apprehended by CBP last month, a 173% increase over February 2020.

1371805874663141378 2021-03-16 08:49:42 -0400 <tedcruz> The crisis at the border is the direct result of the Biden administration's failed immigration policy.  The Biden administration:  ❌ Brought back catch and release  ❌ Halted construction of the wall   ❌ Ended the Remain in Mexico policy
1371530923477499907 2021-03-15 14:37:08 -0400 <tedcruz> Joe Biden halted wall construction, implemented catch-and-release, rescinded Trump era-policies to control entry, dismantled enforcement and deportations all while promising amnesty for illegal aliens.   Instead of having a handle on the situation, Biden created a crisis.

1369085749006598147 2021-03-08 19:40:53 -0400 <tedcruz> And that is the problem with the Dem's bill and why the amendment was solid.  So in terms of what should be rated false, it is statements by Newsweek.
1369085748029366275 2021-03-08 19:40:53 -0400 <tedcruz> It is merely a tax classification which the IRS makes clear.   The IRS says, “You will be considered a United States resident for tax purposes if you meet the substantial presence test for the calendar year.”   That's FOR TAX PURPOSES not immigration purposes.
1369085746993332224 2021-03-08 19:40:53 -0400 <tedcruz> PLUS Newsweek falsely describes what a “lawful resident” is, saying that group is comprised of lawful permanent residents and those who meet the substantial presence test.   That’s false.  The later has NOTHING to do with “lawful”ness.
1369085746087403522 2021-03-08 19:40:52 -0400 <tedcruz> So, they conclude EVERY WORD THAT I SAID IS TRUE (and Dick Durbin’s claims to the contrary are false), but they’re left-wing propagandists, so they still call it “mostly false”!
1369085744481005571 2021-03-08 19:40:52 -0400 <tedcruz> They also admit 676k visa overstays in a single year.   They ignore that those accumulate over decades, and 60% of the 12m total illegal aliens are visa overstays.
1369085741880446978 2021-03-08 19:40:51 -0400 <tedcruz> Yet another example of biased, dishonest “fact-checking.”  Newsweek admits “Individuals who overstay their visas but pay tax in the United States using a Social Security number may be eligible for stimulus payments.”

1369019751217983490 2021-03-08 15:18:38 -0400 <tedcruz> 3/x Q3: Dick, true or false: under the Dem bill, millions of illegal immigrants (w/ SSNs) will receive $1400 checks.  Q4: If that’s not true (you bellowed that it was “a lie!”), why did the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation determine my amendment would save taxpayers $675m?
1369018598195425288 2021-03-08 15:14:03 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x You claim “no illegal immigrants will get checks.”  Q1:  Dick, true or false: 60% of illegal aliens are visa overstays.   Q2: True or false: Migrants who come to US legally on a work visa are allowed to have a SSN, yet when they overstay their visa they become illegal aliens.
1369017527960035331 2021-03-08 15:09:48 -0400 <tedcruz> 1/x This is twice in three days that Durbin has called me a liar.   He’s the one who’s lying.   And he knows it.

Millions of illegal immigrants either WILL or WILL NOT receive $1400 checks.  That’s a question of fact. Lefty “journalists” don’t do facts anymore, so Daily Beast, Vox, etc don’t even pretend to care.

1368689660235571202 2021-03-07 17:26:58 -0400 <tedcruz> 4/x ...that my claim that illegal immigrants would get the $$ was “false.”  FACT 6: Lefty pundits &amp; celebrities like Morgan Fairchild happily repeat the charge that I “lied.” They know none of the facts, but in this politically charged world, the other side must always be wrong.

1360628613448667139 2021-02-13 11:35:15 -0400 <tedcruz> 7/x Q5: “If we put him in a burlap sack &amp; throw him in the river, and he does not float, must we convict?”
1360627725694869514 2021-02-13 11:31:43 -0400 <tedcruz> If the House Managers call Rep Herrera Beutler as a witness, the first witness Trump’s lawyers should call is Nancy Pelosi. Several Qs she should answer:   What did you know about threats to the Capitol?   When?  Did you turn down national guard because of “optics”?
1360623692334706688 2021-02-13 11:15:42 -0400 <tedcruz> 6/x Q4: “(generic) Have any of the House Managers had sexual relations with a Chinese communist spy?  Please explain.”
1360622467526582278 2021-02-13 11:10:50 -0400 <tedcruz> 5/x Q3: “To Manager Swalwell: Tell us about Fang Fang.”

1359577866195906561 2021-02-10 13:59:57 -0400 <tedcruz> Biden continues embrace of communist China.  First, Biden nominates UN Ambassador who gave a paid speech praising China at a Confucius Institute.  Now, Biden rescinds rule requiring disclosure for US universities receiving $$ from Confucius Institutes.  CCP is not our friend.
1359576478179016715 2021-02-10 13:54:26 -0400 <tedcruz> Orwellian:  The words “breast milk” are now forbidden.   Because science.

1359505175816372225 2021-02-10 09:11:06 -0400 <tedcruz> Shameful.  At the outset of the pandemic, the WHO acted as a propagandist for communist China, echoing the CCP’s lies.

1333437175883587585 2020-11-30 10:46:11 -0400 <tedcruz> Alyssa, facts matter. Dems have TWICE filibustered $500Bn in emergency COVID relief.

1332761118532657152 2020-11-28 13:59:46 -0400 <tedcruz> The only coherent answer is NO, neither Biden nor Gen. Flynn violated the Logan Act bc it’s unconstitutional—which is why nobody has been convicted of violating it in the history of the US.  But you want to use it as a partisan cudgel, a weapon to attack your political opponents.
1332759598009372675 2020-11-28 13:53:44 -0400 <tedcruz> Ok, let’s apply your proffered standard:  Ben Rhodes has publicly stated, "foreign leaders are already having phone calls with Joe Biden, talking about the agenda they're going to pursue on Jan. 20.”  Does that mean you think Joe Biden should be prosecuted under the Logan Act?
1332743172435435521 2020-11-28 12:48:28 -0400 <tedcruz> Gosh, I touched a nerve. Facts matter.  FACT 1: you’ve admitted, in 1976 you voted for the Communist candidate for President because, I guess, Jimmy Carter wasn’t liberal enough for you.  FACT 2: you gave $150 Bn to Ayatollah Khamenei, knowing it would be used to kill Americans.
1332412243099705345 2020-11-27 14:53:28 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s bizarre to see a former head of the CIA consistently side with Iranian zealots who chant “Death to America.”  And reflexively condemn Israel.  Does Joe Biden agree?

He wears a mask to speak—when nobody is remotely near him—as an ostentatious sign of fake virtue.  @DanSullivan_AK was over 50 feet away, presiding. Last I checked 50 feet is more than 6 feet.
1328371626057019392 2020-11-16 11:17:30 -0400 <tedcruz> Sadly, it an old pattern (the reverse of the media narrative):  The Dems take from the poor &amp; give to the rich.   Blue-collar workers get screwed, but politically connected elites get rich from big government.
1328367836394352642 2020-11-16 11:02:26 -0400 <tedcruz> I don’t really care about this particular controversy, but I feel obliged to point out one of the odder factoids of the past few years: on Jeffrey Epstein’s living-room wall, we learned, was an oil painting of Bill Clinton in a dress.   I have no idea why.
1328366986435452929 2020-11-16 10:59:04 -0400 <tedcruz> Absolutely right.
1328097090795425793 2020-11-15 17:06:35 -0400 <tedcruz> Why is the media ignoring this?  Why are Dems silent?
1328095173205774339 2020-11-15 16:58:58 -0400 <tedcruz> Violent rioting—from Left or Right—is unacceptable.   If you commit acts of violence, you should be arrested. Immediately.   Where are the police??    Why are Dem politicians condoning BLM/ANTIFA violent assaults?
1327393476003160064 2020-11-13 18:30:41 -0400 <tedcruz> Yep. 🦃 🦃
1327393246671155201 2020-11-13 18:29:46 -0400 <tedcruz> Not satire: “Baby Yoda, who 1 yr ago cozied into our hearts w/ bottomless eyes &amp; adorable cooing, has invoked social media wrath for episode of Mandalorian, in which the mystical infant remorselessly snacked on the eggs of an endangered galactic species.”  https://t.co/cpvcPGX2ig
1327314001441722370 2020-11-13 13:14:52 -0400 <tedcruz> The Georgia Senate races are indescribably important. The entire country hinges upon the outcome of these runoffs:  https://t.co/nQdIIxoHcM #GASen
1327288052297965568 2020-11-13 11:31:46 -0400 <tedcruz> 1, 10 &amp; 11.   And 11 is definitely a Christmas movie.
1327286517211992064 2020-11-13 11:25:40 -0400 <tedcruz> Reasonable question.   Also, in any sane world, the recount should include the Senate race. Perdue is just 12k votes from winning outright, without a runoff.
1327285390429073410 2020-11-13 11:21:11 -0400 <tedcruz> They will boycott you. They will try to get you fired from your job. They will harass your family and threaten your safety.   This is the angry, intolerant Left. They demand complete obedience. Or else.   #Robespierre
1327283659884392457 2020-11-13 11:14:18 -0400 <tedcruz> Awesome. 🇺🇸🇺🇸
1327282589997133824 2020-11-13 11:10:03 -0400 <tedcruz> They will always tell you their greatest fears.  This simple tweet—forwarding the exact text of a PA district court order that the Secretary of State violated the law—is driving Lefties nuts.   “I can’t believe you went to Harvard!!” they spew, sputtering with rage.   Revealing.
1326994467551850498 2020-11-12 16:05:10 -0400 <tedcruz> The intern writing Bloomberg tweets was apparently, literally, born yesterday.  https://t.co/ym3TsCBWOs

1326982139162800131 2020-11-12 15:16:10 -0400 <tedcruz> Terrifying.   Today’s Dems don’t even pretend to believe in Free Speech.  Now they are threatening to criminalize dissent.

1326570004813406208 2020-11-11 11:58:30 -0400 <tedcruz> They prosecuted General Flynn for doing this.
1326530106316255232 2020-11-11 09:19:57 -0400 <tedcruz> This is bizarre Leftist pablum.   The government’s first priority should be to protect Americans.

1326193456444739586 2020-11-10 11:02:14 -0400 <tedcruz> Awesome! Only time I’ve ever been linked in any way to Ike AND Willie Nelson.   Damn strong company!
1326176741866483713 2020-11-10 09:55:49 -0400 <tedcruz> Happy birthday to @USMC! 🇺🇸
1326160535931547650 2020-11-10 08:51:25 -0400 <tedcruz> Jake, why didn’t Pfizer announce their vaccine until 48 hours—literally—after the networks called the race for Biden?  They didn’t know about it last week?
1326152695326060546 2020-11-10 08:20:15 -0400 <tedcruz> Miraculous. COVID cured, the very instant the networks called the race for Biden.
1325993311132413952 2020-11-09 21:46:55 -0400 <tedcruz> The fundamental question is: are we going to follow the law?  We need to let the process play out to ensure every legal vote that was cast is counted and every vote that was illegally cast is not.  https://t.co/G4WA5CPRE9
1325968110101422081 2020-11-09 20:06:47 -0400 <tedcruz> Now Twitter is flagging tweets about the radical Dem agenda if they win the GA Senate races as somehow “disputed.”  What the hell???  It’s what they campaigned on.
1325899824437321729 2020-11-09 15:35:26 -0400 <tedcruz> I miss Alex Trebek. He was simply the best. Erudite and all class. Heidi &amp; I are lifting up his family in prayer. RIP.

1325804175289094149 2020-11-09 09:15:22 -0400 <tedcruz> Why now?  🤔
1325561237657317376 2020-11-08 17:10:01 -0400 <tedcruz> Do you want Chuck Schumer to “change the world”?  Twitter might, but I don’t believe the people of Georgia do.
1325558185214705664 2020-11-08 16:57:53 -0400 <tedcruz> Chris Wallace, who beclowned himself with a shamefully biased debate performance—universally panned—continues to demonstrate his rank partisanship.  Urging that we follow the law &amp; that election recounts be actually completed is not somehow undermining democracy.
1325495515748950018 2020-11-08 12:48:52 -0400 <tedcruz> The media does not get to select our President.  The American people get to elect our President.  At this point, we should allow the rule of law and legal process to operate.  https://t.co/W3SaDLquPY

1325200383300481026 2020-11-07 17:16:07 -0400 <tedcruz> Chuck Schumer’s new plan: “Take Georgia...change the world.”  We have a better plan: re-elect @Perduesenate and @KLoeffler, defend our Senate Majority, and stand for Liberty:  https://t.co/T4sdo6aeQz #GASen
1324819417566486528 2020-11-06 16:02:17 -0400 <tedcruz> Absolutely true. Sadly, Friedman is pushing partisan revisionist history.
1324730865637859331 2020-11-06 10:10:25 -0400 <tedcruz> When you’re breaking the law, ignoring court orders, counting ballots in secret &amp; threatening to steal the presidency, it’s not “PA’s business.”  It’s America’s business, and we have the right to expect votes will be counted (1) fairly, (2) w/ transparency &amp; (3) NOT in secret.
1324601373296676866 2020-11-06 01:35:51 -0400 <tedcruz> Nope. You’re being deliberately dishonest.  Someone 20 ft away—forced to use binoculars—is not an “observer” under the law. Not if they can’t see what ballot counters are actually doing.  Since most Dems will just believe your rhetoric—despite the facts—READ the court ruling:  https://t.co/4flnbHF0RK
1324599089275850752 2020-11-06 01:26:47 -0400 <tedcruz> Dem partisans claim “there have been observers....”   But, Dem operatives kept them so far away THEY HAD TO USE BINOCULARS to see the ballots. (see pic below)  That’s why a PA court ordered they must be allowed WITHIN SIX FEET.  https://t.co/BBtpAhD0Ii
1324558397417549824 2020-11-05 22:45:05 -0400 <tedcruz> I am angry.   The American people are right to be angry.   We need observers.   Now.  https://t.co/c8pnMj2jdf

1324484838473302018 2020-11-05 17:52:47 -0400 <tedcruz> Strong.
1324479974741626885 2020-11-05 17:33:28 -0400 <tedcruz> Now Twitter is censoring the video I forwarded....  @jack Does anyone dispute that Philly is keeping ballot observers away, contrary to law?  If not, why the Twitter “warning”?
1324479377783009281 2020-11-05 17:31:05 -0400 <tedcruz> Fox News &amp; AP both made a HUGE mistake calling Arizona for Biden. Before the votes were counted.  Trump still has a real path to win AZ. So does McSally.   Even CNN admits it.
1324224097161744384 2020-11-05 00:36:42 -0400 <tedcruz> hmm....
1324223709306126336 2020-11-05 00:35:09 -0400 <tedcruz> If true, this is HIGHLY disturbing.   Elections should be decided by actual voters, not unscrupulous political operatives after the fact.

1318654495937777665 2020-10-20 16:45:05 -0400 <tedcruz> An unusually brazen falsehood. Which the media ignores.  Schumer says 20+ Republicans won’t spend “a dime more” on Covid, literally AT THE SAME TIME........the Dems are filibustering $500 BILLION in new Covid emergency relief.  52 Republicans are supporting.   ZERO Dems.
1318648145228800001 2020-10-20 16:19:51 -0400 <tedcruz> “According to sources, emergency legislation was drafted after it was discovered that 97% of Californians favor destroying every small business on the planet and salting the earth where the businesses once stood.”  Might be a slight exaggeration....

1318542867326029824 2020-10-20 09:21:31 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s a shame to see AEI scholar regurgitating left-wing talking points that are demonstrably false.

1318520859804553222 2020-10-20 07:54:04 -0400 <tedcruz> The Left keeps repeating this idiotic arg: “Ha! Ha!

1306736092243210241 2020-09-17 19:25:37 -0400 <tedcruz> PBS Leftist reporter lionizes the  NYT’s 1619 Project (“a national treasure”), despite it being an explicit propaganda effort designed to “reframe” American history.  It’s been repeatedly debunked by serious historians as based on lies. So PBS tells us we should be “grateful.”
1306692735496196101 2020-09-17 16:33:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Great example of biased reporting. This fellow says he’s a “news desk reporter.”  Take a look at his language:  “who has often been accused of disregarding the constitution,” &amp; “fierce backlash from commentators, who RECOGNIZED it as authoritarian.”  He cites ONLY Lefty critics.

1305241067051196417 2020-09-13 16:24:55 -0400 <tedcruz> Lefty site in full Dem-defense mode. WATCH the clip.   Despite the headline, they don’t dispute the facts: (1) movie sexually exploits kids, (2) Netflix making $$ from distributing; and (3) Netflix pays Obama big bucks.   Child porn is not OK.

And it is a federal felony.  Why are supposedly “mainstream” journalists going out of their way to defend child porn?
1304878691311398912 2020-09-12 16:24:58 -0400 <tedcruz> Some professor seems to be under the mistaken impression that, if child pornography is produced overseas, U.S. companies can distribute it here in the United States without facing criminal liability.  Although perhaps a popular view in the faculty lounge, that is not federal law.

1298446091055239168 2020-08-25 22:24:06 -0400 <tedcruz> The MSM definition of “gaffe”:  when someone accidentally (briefly) reports the truth.   WATCH this.   WHO ordered the word “violent” be deleted? WHY?

1298357423745507328 2020-08-25 16:31:46 -0400 <tedcruz> Chip, the media hates “uppity” minorities. If you’re Black or Hispanic or Indian-American &amp; you deviate from Left-wing orthodoxy, they vilify you.  As Joe Biden put it, “you ain’t Black.”  Nikki can go by whatever damn name she chooses, and her immigrant story remains powerful.

1298305972868390914 2020-08-25 13:07:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Tragic. Looters &amp; rioters are not peaceful protesters.   Destroying small businesses does nothing to further social justice.

1298289464113090560 2020-08-25 12:01:43 -0400 <tedcruz> The Democrats founded the KKK, wrote Jim Crow, and have a current Dem governor (VA) who placed a picture of a Klansman on his own yearbook page. So this latest endorsement of Biden only continues that trend.  https://t.co/0KrOAIclJE

1297987566432649223 2020-08-24 16:02:05 -0400 <tedcruz> Too many in the media are fully committed to tearing down America. This “journalist” claims the United States is worse than Nazi Germany.   That slander is objectively false, absurd, and grossly disrespectful to the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust.
1297941485929639936 2020-08-24 12:58:59 -0400 <tedcruz> "I would shut it down."  This is the Biden economic agenda. Destroy every small business in America. Kill tens of millions more jobs.   This is madness.

1296521847434096640 2020-08-20 14:57:51 -0400 <tedcruz> As I said yesterday, there's an enormous amount of disinfo being peddled about Nord Stream 2. There's campaign saying our Euro allies are suddenly in favor of Putin's pipeline. And as I said yesterday it's not going to work because that's not true and our allies will just say so.
1296420330140049410 2020-08-20 08:14:27 -0400 <tedcruz> When will Democrats speak up?   Will they stand with the brave men and women of law enforcement who risk life and limb to protect our communities?  I wouldn’t count on it.  https://t.co/6h8Ruw9SkO
1296268344245383170 2020-08-19 22:10:31 -0400 <tedcruz> There's an enormous amount of disinformation about Nord Stream 2 right now.   That includes a ridiculous campaign telling European countries that oppose Putin's pipeline that actually they don't oppose it.   But this gaslighting is bound to fail as it just did.

1295824267804844034 2020-08-18 16:45:55 -0400 <tedcruz> Today’s Dems look at America and say, you know what we need?  (1) No more police, and  (2) More felons working for the government.   Strange world-view.

1295737050784763905 2020-08-18 10:59:21 -0400 <tedcruz> Marco &amp; I haven’t always agreed, but to see him slandered by this oleaginous cretin is shameful. Schmidt wouldn’t understand—he’s spent his life serving, &amp; then betraying, powerful men—but for those whose families suffered &amp; bled under Castro’s tyrannny, this is beyond the pale.
1295696258951188480 2020-08-18 08:17:15 -0400 <tedcruz> Important read.
1295680949955567616 2020-08-18 07:16:25 -0400 <tedcruz> Tragically, this is happening all over the country. Good people are fleeing the police force because of the abuse they’re taking, with the complicity &amp; active encouragement of Dem politicians.   This is not good for America.
1295583317161652224 2020-08-18 00:48:28 -0400 <tedcruz> Deranged.
1295530035458256897 2020-08-17 21:16:44 -0400 <tedcruz> Yep. It saved a lot of jobs then, and Dems are still trying to destroy those jobs today.   A world without FedEx, a world without Uber—which is what Dems are demanding—is a world with much less opportunity.

1295519762596925440 2020-08-17 20:35:55 -0400 <tedcruz> GRAPHIC &amp; very disturbing.

Translation: Trump hatred endangers lives.
1287408800325160960 2020-07-26 11:25:51 -0400 <tedcruz> Yale epidemiologist says hydroxychloroquine is “highly effective” on COVID: “When this inexpensive oral medication is given very early in the course of illness, before the virus has had time to multiply beyond control, it has shown to be highly effective.”  https://t.co/jH3z3NQ3Ei

1287111646691954702 2020-07-25 15:45:04 -0400 <tedcruz> Chris, seeing the media gleefully report the virus in red states is really sad.

1276988340235939840 2020-06-27 17:18:40 -0400 <tedcruz> Tragic. This will cost Black lives. This will make schoolchildren more vulnerable to violent crime, sexual assault, drug &amp; gang violence, and even murder.

1275525200554188803 2020-06-23 16:24:40 -0400 <tedcruz> Beyond satire.   Twitter is literally censoring the President of the United States for saying that violent anarchists will not be allowed to take over our nation’s capital &amp; that law enforcement will act to protect public safety.  In Big Tech’s Orwellian world, that’s “abusive.”
1275470731732815872 2020-06-23 12:48:14 -0400 <tedcruz> Watch:  Why is CNN disseminating propaganda? In support of anarchy?  It the wake of multiple murders, rapes &amp; violent assaults in the CHAZ/CHOP lawless zone, will CNN be issuing a correction for its repeated false reporting that everything was “peaceful”?
1275469354134634497 2020-06-23 12:42:45 -0400 <tedcruz> Nobody has felt the sting of racial oppression like wealthy white women.  Perhaps if they hadn’t lived their lives safe &amp; protected by law enforcement, they wouldn’t be so angry &amp; ready to abolish police (regardless of how many minorities would be victims of crime as a result).

1273831473947316225 2020-06-19 00:14:24 -0400 <tedcruz> This makes no sense. How is it somehow promoting racial justice to remove all positive images of African Americans in advertising?  How is it better for ads to feature only white guys?
1273699681017659392 2020-06-18 15:30:42 -0400 <tedcruz> Democratic SCOTUS nominees NEVER do this.   Republican Presidents keep screwing this up. They don’t care enough to insist on the proven conservative record of a Scalia, Thomas, Rehnquist, or Alito.
1273697983666642944 2020-06-18 15:23:58 -0400 <tedcruz> That’s not easy to do.

Because Stalin, Mao, Castro &amp; their ilk murdered over 100 million people, imprisoned and tortured millions more &amp; produced crushing poverty that lead to starvation, misery &amp; death. Welcome to Marx, indeed.
1273323434387419136 2020-06-17 14:35:38 -0400 <tedcruz> Google censorship wrong, dangerous &amp; illegal.  https://t.co/yPaHUha84l
1273312362909614080 2020-06-17 13:51:38 -0400 <tedcruz> Still remember holding my breath watching game 5, where the Rockets fell behind the Knicks 3-2, on split-screen with OJ’s white Bronco racing down the highway. Surreal.   Thankfully, we came back &amp; won the next two games (I was at game 7) to win our first championship! 🚀 🚀
1273309697995571213 2020-06-17 13:41:03 -0400 <tedcruz> Woke ignorance:  As a matter of history, this is only off by several thousand years.
1273308632600494084 2020-06-17 13:36:49 -0400 <tedcruz> Insulting. And not helpful.
1273299674141790208 2020-06-17 13:01:13 -0400 <tedcruz> Endless propaganda. This is a taxpayer-funded show targeted at Pre-K children. It doesn’t need to be talking about sex or sexuality at all.
1272713479758249985 2020-06-15 22:11:54 -0400 <tedcruz> Shh....
1272677700805820416 2020-06-15 19:49:43 -0400 <tedcruz> Bravo.
1272619983240036355 2020-06-15 16:00:22 -0400 <tedcruz> True.  Although that’s not how Planned Parenthood usually markets themselves.
1272536401251311616 2020-06-15 10:28:15 -0400 <tedcruz> Sadly, your Mayor, Governor, State Legislature &amp; both Senators are all Democrat. (Just like Minneapolis.)  They won’t do their job:  they value woke virtue signaling more than actually protecting the lives &amp; safety of their citizens.  Come to Texas!
1272496026197413888 2020-06-15 07:47:49 -0400 <tedcruz> I get it, you’re rich. But, apparently, soft. You sure seem scared to wrestle Jordan (whom you keep insulting).   Can’t take the heat?  Need to get a manicure?
1272401558869807105 2020-06-15 01:32:26 -0400 <tedcruz> Sounds fishy to me.
1272397279287218178 2020-06-15 01:15:26 -0400 <tedcruz> Now this seems worthwhile: replace statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest—former delegate to 1860 Democrat National Convention, vicious slave trader &amp; the founder of the KKK—with the great Dolly Parton. A win-win!
1272395381767385089 2020-06-15 01:07:53 -0400 <tedcruz> Uhhh...take a look at Brooklyn.
1272395050673229828 2020-06-15 01:06:34 -0400 <tedcruz> Wait till they bring out the guillotines.
1272394147492659200 2020-06-15 01:02:59 -0400 <tedcruz> Excellent. US Congress should do the same.   The Senate has already passed the Cruz-Kaine resolution explicitly condemning anti-semitism (something the House sadly failed to do) and BDS specifically. It passed 100 to nothing. Every D and every R.  Nancy, ball’s in your court.
1272390385327837193 2020-06-15 00:48:02 -0400 <tedcruz> Listen Hellboy. You talk good game when you’ve got Hollywood makeup &amp; stuntmen. But I’ll bet $10k—to the nonpolitical charity of your choice—that you couldn’t last 5 min in the wrestling ring w/ @Jim_Jordan w/o getting pinned. You up for it?  Or does your publicist say too risky?
1272388691219156992 2020-06-15 00:41:18 -0400 <tedcruz> @blessed4home @SenTedCruz This one was me.
1272388340734705666 2020-06-15 00:39:54 -0400 <tedcruz> I see the same thing in Congress.
1272355605773254658 2020-06-14 22:29:50 -0400 <tedcruz> The modern Left:  they cancel Gone With the Wind...and then burn Atlanta.
1272351577739853824 2020-06-14 22:13:49 -0400 <tedcruz> Lest anyone think CNN is a news organization....  https://t.co/Enl3qULd4o
1272346115569061888 2020-06-14 21:52:07 -0400 <tedcruz> This is the tolerant Left.
1272342869353865221 2020-06-14 21:39:13 -0400 <tedcruz> Life without police:  A Democrat agenda for every city in America.
1272283474888704001 2020-06-14 17:43:12 -0400 <tedcruz> Now that’s funny.
1272282392624074753 2020-06-14 17:38:54 -0400 <tedcruz> I hope that’s not what you’re planning to do to the NYPD.
1272280747559223296 2020-06-14 17:32:22 -0400 <tedcruz> Very sad. Prayers for the entire Williams family.
1272280319874543616 2020-06-14 17:30:40 -0400 <tedcruz> Curious. And whom does the media blame?
1272279860694732813 2020-06-14 17:28:51 -0400 <tedcruz> Yes.
1272279654217506816 2020-06-14 17:28:02 -0400 <tedcruz> Come and Take It.
1272277392023867393 2020-06-14 17:19:02 -0400 <tedcruz> This is sad.
1272213077593899010 2020-06-14 13:03:28 -0400 <tedcruz> Important read. Israel is an ally and a sovereign nation entitled to make this decision for itself. Far too many in America have been presumptuous in trying to dictate the terms of peace to them.  https://t.co/p2mWqYCXcr
1271902686577856512 2020-06-13 16:30:05 -0400 <tedcruz> Who voted for the warlords?
1271893050961395714 2020-06-13 15:51:48 -0400 <tedcruz> Please stop being ridiculous. #ThisIsNuts
1271675737502867456 2020-06-13 01:28:17 -0400 <tedcruz> This is REALLY bad for America.
1271672646552432644 2020-06-13 01:16:00 -0400 <tedcruz> This idiocy has got to stop.  And if we demonize all cops, who in their right mind will choose to become one?  SVU is about stopping rapists and pedophiles. Do these woke imbeciles really think the world would be better if police didn’t arrest sexual predators?
1271636569527668736 2020-06-12 22:52:38 -0400 <tedcruz> Problem solved.

1271581897051815939 2020-06-12 19:15:23 -0400 <tedcruz> Pelosi calls for removing racist Democrats from the Capitol.
1271577713556537345 2020-06-12 18:58:46 -0400 <tedcruz> Exactly right.  https://t.co/aYg6jTEh0e
1271567207944925184 2020-06-12 18:17:01 -0400 <tedcruz> CHAZ. “Summer of Love.”  https://t.co/1kaBH2dYkY
1271565517900390402 2020-06-12 18:10:18 -0400 <tedcruz> Remember when the Left believed in free speech?  And academic freedom?  No more.
1271529771806195712 2020-06-12 15:48:16 -0400 <tedcruz> Prayers for Deputy Nicholas Dryfus.
1271528755153035266 2020-06-12 15:44:13 -0400 <tedcruz> Wow.
1271528416366469126 2020-06-12 15:42:52 -0400 <tedcruz> The lunatics are (not) running the asylum.
1271527976249839622 2020-06-12 15:41:08 -0400 <tedcruz> Liberated billions. 🇺🇸🇺🇸
1271527162185728000 2020-06-12 15:37:53 -0400 <tedcruz> A very good Q.
1271521369478647819 2020-06-12 15:14:52 -0400 <tedcruz> Hollywood now imposing racial quotas on filmmakers. Details not yet available.
1271498206992621569 2020-06-12 13:42:50 -0400 <tedcruz> Of course not.   The Klan is evil, but he was a Democrat. He was Senate Majority Leader just 30 yrs ago &amp; was a leading Dem in the US Senate until 2010, just ten yrs ago.  He’s been effusively praised by Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer &amp; Joe Biden.   Even though he was a Klansman.
1271495307705176070 2020-06-12 13:31:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Brian, are you saying it’s newsworthy who you’re sleeping with?  How about show some decency &amp; leave people’s personal lives alone? Focus on, say, news.
1271494506731446274 2020-06-12 13:28:08 -0400 <tedcruz> The wizard commanded it.
1271494078782464000 2020-06-12 13:26:26 -0400 <tedcruz> An American hero.   His horrific murder shocked the nation and helped liberate millions through the civil rights movement.

1271385669055778823 2020-06-12 06:15:39 -0400 <tedcruz> Has this statue been toppled yet?   Hard to find someone (other than Hitler, Stalin, or Mao) responsible for more torture &amp; murder....
1271381456405901315 2020-06-12 05:58:54 -0400 <tedcruz> I’d say send in Snake Pliskin, but it’s more a job for Dora the Explorer....
1271246614414471169 2020-06-11 21:03:06 -0400 <tedcruz> Madness.
1271169976615960576 2020-06-11 15:58:34 -0400 <tedcruz> 👀   Huge guest coming on #Verdict tomorrow morning.   Subscribe here ( https://t.co/sTPmzf0cqF) for @markmeadows' first sit down interview since becoming @WhiteHouse  Chief of Staff.  https://t.co/yiwsqvVaMQ
1271154145739800578 2020-06-11 14:55:39 -0400 <tedcruz> Secret undercover video taken from inside the CHAZ Autonomous Zone.   https://t.co/RWWeEMPYNF
1271112304176832513 2020-06-11 12:09:24 -0400 <tedcruz> Already written.  https://t.co/shOdyj36CC
1271091100334383105 2020-06-11 10:45:08 -0400 <tedcruz> Even for Tribe (with late-stage TDS) this is overwrought &amp; hysterical. Almost as if he knows any real judge would laugh the argument out of court.  “No, under Article III, the court doesn’t get to be the prosecutor too....”
1271089523859116032 2020-06-11 10:38:52 -0400 <tedcruz> Lord of the Flies in downtown Seattle. What could go wrong?
1271087648652824577 2020-06-11 10:31:25 -0400 <tedcruz> @deeg25 Yes!
1271087412001767424 2020-06-11 10:30:29 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x And if you want to talk “literal genocide,” we can discuss the Nazis murdering 6 million Jews in the Holocaust.   Why again did you oppose the House resolution against antisemitism?
1271086702556299266 2020-06-11 10:27:40 -0400 <tedcruz> No, he didn’t commit genocide, “literally” or otherwise. He did discover the New World, which led to colonizers, some of whom inadvertently brought disease.  Is it your position that it’s inherently immoral to come to America from a foreign land?  I’m glad my Dad came from Cuba.
1271073984675790849 2020-06-11 09:37:08 -0400 <tedcruz> Because Hong Kong protesters are standing against an oppressive communist govt that tortures &amp; murders people &amp; whose Wuhan cover up caused a global pandemic.   Murder is wrong. When CCP does it or when ANTIFA does it.   And the Taliban tore down statues too, to re-write history.
1271072019174625283 2020-06-11 09:29:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Tear everything down. Burn everything down. That’s the path to peace.
1271071560535814144 2020-06-11 09:27:30 -0400 <tedcruz> Are they chanting “build the wall”?
1271069854930538503 2020-06-11 09:20:43 -0400 <tedcruz> “Liberated streets.”

1271067830730010625 2020-06-11 09:12:40 -0400 <tedcruz> This must be The Onion.
1270935844183060480 2020-06-11 00:28:12 -0400 <tedcruz> It was bound to happen.
1270911233676410880 2020-06-10 22:50:25 -0400 <tedcruz> Bravo, Sir Charles: “We need the cops, most of the cops do a fantastic job, but instead of defunding &amp; all this other stuff, let’s just do police reform. Everybody should be on board for that whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, conservative or liberal.”  https://t.co/3GjmVxz2Bv
1270907017784369159 2020-06-10 22:33:40 -0400 <tedcruz> The absurdity knows no end. #CancelCultureTargetsCartoons  https://t.co/bfHBBvg5sD
1270898590697885701 2020-06-10 22:00:10 -0400 <tedcruz> Joe, thanks to Harry Reid, you can’t stop it. 🤷🏻‍♂️  We’ll keep confirming constitutionalist judges because that’s what the American people elected us to do.
1270889715235983366 2020-06-10 21:24:54 -0400 <tedcruz> American Taliban.
1270882351908884480 2020-06-10 20:55:39 -0400 <tedcruz> Yes, yes...prosecute &amp; imprison journalists who say things we don’t like.   This is the tolerant Left.
1270880412064264194 2020-06-10 20:47:56 -0400 <tedcruz> Surely this is satire.  https://t.co/cH6K37OSmj
1270878091641061376 2020-06-10 20:38:43 -0400 <tedcruz> Powerful.
1270875618444525571 2020-06-10 20:28:53 -0400 <tedcruz> “Finally”??  LeBron has always been political, whether he’s shilling for Dems (Hillary, Beto, Biden), excoriating Drew Brees for (briefly) defending the American flag, or apologizing for the Chinese Communist Party.
1270873884905046017 2020-06-10 20:22:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Breathtaking.
1270868898343198720 2020-06-10 20:02:11 -0400 <tedcruz> Uh, Brian, review your history. From 1934-68 the Production Code Administration—enforced by the Hollywood trade organization—enforced strict censorship. It wasn’t govt, but it was damn well censorship.   (That’s what HBO is revisiting.)  Learn more:  https://t.co/bJHnxWKqlM
1270846625477529600 2020-06-10 18:33:41 -0400 <tedcruz> Hey ⁦@JoeBiden⁩ do you agree with hateful Dem Rep. Omar—whose endorsement you proudly touted—that police officers are “a cancer” who must be totally defunded?  https://t.co/kLbuiRlwkf
1270843835833356294 2020-06-10 18:22:36 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s almost like people like freedom....  And are tired of the angry, woke, totalitarian scolds who are trying to censor the world.
1270819049178447872 2020-06-10 16:44:06 -0400 <tedcruz> MUST WATCH: @MichaelJKnowles and I discuss Bill De Blasio's hypocrisy and more on the latest episode of #Verdict:  https://t.co/veedWqfUsu
1270811989166755842 2020-06-10 16:16:03 -0400 <tedcruz> Here’s a radical idea:  Don’t censor Gone With The Wind.   Don’t censor Blazing Saddles.   Don’t censor Quentin Tarantino.   Don’t censor ANYTHING.   #FreeSpeech #ArtisticFreedom
1270718961168994304 2020-06-10 10:06:23 -0400 <tedcruz> You know that Tom Perez, the head of the DNC, said that anybody who is pro-life is “not welcome in the Democratic Party”?  Your party would—literally—kick the Pope out.   That’s how extreme your Dem Party has gotten.
1270718166788796422 2020-06-10 10:03:14 -0400 <tedcruz> This will be an expensive exercise in virtue signaling. Because their explicit race-based discrimination is willfully in defiance of federal civil rights laws, Uber Eats will lose EVERY ONE of the lawsuits that are about to be filed.
1270716162662264835 2020-06-10 09:55:16 -0400 <tedcruz> We honor his life of service and sacrifice. #RIPDavidDorn

1270506482560372737 2020-06-09 20:02:04 -0400 <tedcruz> Come to Texas!  We love jobs in TX &amp; law enforcement is committed to keeping everyone safe.  https://t.co/x4VyZfTtSq
1270481787353886721 2020-06-09 18:23:57 -0400 <tedcruz> These movements to abolish and dismantle police departments are stark raving nuts...  More on #Verdict with @tedcruz and @MichaelJKnowles:  https://t.co/v1FRDfPRFG
1270471035784253440 2020-06-09 17:41:13 -0400 <tedcruz> Powerful.
1270465812260937730 2020-06-09 17:20:28 -0400 <tedcruz> Watch this. THANK YOU to the @NYCPBA for risking your lives to keep us safe. Thank you for protecting everyone, for defending our rights, regardless of race or ethnicity.
1270463419351785472 2020-06-09 17:10:57 -0400 <tedcruz> This is endangering people’s lives. #ThisIsNuts
1270371095938564098 2020-06-09 11:04:06 -0400 <tedcruz> I am proud to offer my endorsement and support to @adkins_2020 for Congress in #KS03, and I am asking you to join me in supporting her:  https://t.co/IeEujJ6YwD #BuilderBeliever
1270121161934995456 2020-06-08 18:30:57 -0400 <tedcruz> Dems have lost their minds. Having met repeatedly w/victims, parents &amp; teachers hurt by gun violence in schools, the single most effective way to keep our kids safe is more armed police officers in schools.   This idiotic proposal would tragically result in MORE school shootings.
1270112076606910466 2020-06-08 17:54:51 -0400 <tedcruz> You keep on using those words. I do not think they mean what you think they mean.
1270110634441609217 2020-06-08 17:49:07 -0400 <tedcruz> Lunatic Left completes its takeover of Dem Party.
1270108057268367365 2020-06-08 17:38:52 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s about time CNN embraced transparency!  https://t.co/LHE5Y7vLm2
1270009887754457093 2020-06-08 11:08:47 -0400 <tedcruz> Tragic.  So how would “abolishing the police” save these lives?  Or would this become the norm EVERY day?
1270006516477841412 2020-06-08 10:55:23 -0400 <tedcruz> The lunatic Left now says it’s a sign of “privilege” not to want your home broken into. #ThisIsNuts
1270006002667139074 2020-06-08 10:53:21 -0400 <tedcruz> Tragically, this will cost many more live.
1270003406539837441 2020-06-08 10:43:02 -0400 <tedcruz> yup

1269859163624157184 2020-06-08 01:09:52 -0400 <tedcruz> This...is...insane.  If Minneapolis (and NYC and DC) follow through on the radical Left’s plan to “defund the police” MANY more black lives will be lost.   #ThisIsNuts
1269857708863299584 2020-06-08 01:04:05 -0400 <tedcruz> The NYT literally fired their editorial page editor because he dared publish an op-ed that Leftists disagreed with.   The totalitarian Left will brook no dissent. To hell with Free Speech—we are Pravda.   New York Times: founded as an actual newspaper 9/18/1851.  Died: 6/7/2020.
1269853606641049601 2020-06-08 00:47:47 -0400 <tedcruz> The natural response to riots &amp; the city on fire...we need fewer police. #ThisIsNuts
1269684852758061058 2020-06-07 13:37:13 -0400 <tedcruz> It is wrong to deny families the right to grieve together, to comfort their loved ones in times of sickness or death. Enough is enough.
1269382043898654726 2020-06-06 17:33:57 -0400 <tedcruz> Good for @saletan He’s a Lefty journalist who disagrees with @TomCottonAR (and me) on just about everything, but he’s got the integrity to call out the NYT’s BS hypocrisy.
1269333792373817345 2020-06-06 14:22:13 -0400 <tedcruz> 76 years ago today—REAL anti-fascism.  Notice:   (1) they’re shooting Nazis, not police officers.   (2) they’re protecting the innocent, not robbing them.  https://t.co/fLMcY6eP98
1269285827747540994 2020-06-06 11:11:38 -0400 <tedcruz> So, in March, at the start of coronavirus lockdown, I went on Amazon to try to buy toilet paper. I bought the only kind that was available. It finally arrived yesterday, shipped from China. Pitiful! 🤨🤨  https://t.co/GeQqdzhTHw
1269283581584703489 2020-06-06 11:02:42 -0400 <tedcruz> RIP David Dorn.
1269282094024478720 2020-06-06 10:56:47 -0400 <tedcruz> Journalism is dead.
1269281206711050240 2020-06-06 10:53:16 -0400 <tedcruz> Amy, screaming “nuh uh!” is not refutation, even if it impressed Mother Jones. Maybe address the FACTS I discussed:  On 1/4/17 FBI decided to close the case against Gen Flynn bc there was “no evidence.”  On 1/5 Comey met w/ Obama &amp; Biden to target Flynn.   Biden unmasked Flynn.
1269279001299869699 2020-06-06 10:44:30 -0400 <tedcruz> 91 seconds.  This is not news. It is pure propaganda. They know it. They don’t care. They are Pravda.
1269278354676604930 2020-06-06 10:41:56 -0400 <tedcruz> On National Gun Violence Day, is this a good day for Joe Biden to “defund the police”?
1269277953713737730 2020-06-06 10:40:20 -0400 <tedcruz> If you had more OF THE CRIMINALS wearing orange— the gangbangers &amp; murderers who are killing so many innocent black people—that would do a lot more to stop gun violence.  Maybe it was a mistake for the Obama DOJ to decrease gun crime prosecution by 45%?  https://t.co/lrCIT4fxFO
1269276108991672321 2020-06-06 10:33:01 -0400 <tedcruz> A good point. Only a socialist revolution—putting really old white people in charge of everything—can possibly fix it.
1269052101402992641 2020-06-05 19:42:53 -0400 <tedcruz> Twitter’s at it again. Blocks GOP candidate &amp; veteran ⁦@RichforGA⁩ video doing push-ups for PTSD.  https://t.co/EBMWAKOX9N

1268946550018969604 2020-06-05 12:43:28 -0400 <tedcruz> Keith Nielsen should resign.  Dammit, stop it. Stop saying stupid, racist things. Our country is grieving.  Let’s come together for equal justice under law. Let’s unite behind Dr. King’s powerful dream, where all of us are judged, not by race, but by the content of our character.

1268770614443155457 2020-06-05 01:04:21 -0400 <tedcruz> Beyond satire.  Yesterday: “It would undermine integrity &amp; independence of NYT if we only published views that editors agreed with”  Today: “We’re sorry we thought integrity was more important than insulating our staff from scary ideas. Won’t happen again”  https://t.co/RtSqQkLjk9
1268616854899167232 2020-06-04 14:53:22 -0400 <tedcruz> Cynthia Brehm’s comments were wrong, and only serve to divide us at a time when we all need to come together. Given those harmful comments, she should resign from leadership.
1268597969131057153 2020-06-04 13:38:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Infantalized news, by reporters seeking safe spaces free from dissenting views.  Alternatively, the journalists could behave like adults, allow views they disagree with to be published, and then disagree on the merits.   (Which, to be fair, is what NYT did, much to their dismay.)
1268595466951950336 2020-06-04 13:28:23 -0400 <tedcruz> Remember the hardened, grizzled reporters “speaking truth to power”?  Now NYT reporters are clutching their little blankets, stroking their comfort chinchillas, and saying, “Mommy! Protect me from the scary words!”  This is how civilizations crumble.  https://t.co/DC5CXXjMO4
1268560141680611328 2020-06-04 11:08:01 -0400 <tedcruz> Hillary’s press secretary makes the 2020 Dem agenda clear:  “Defund the police.”  Take your guns.   Cheer on the rioters &amp; looters who burn your city.   It’s like Mad Max at Thunderdome, brought home to America.
1268558337186189314 2020-06-04 11:00:50 -0400 <tedcruz> Sadly predictable.   Pro sports have become PC speech police, terrified of offending the angry Left.   Words you can no longer say in today’s NFL: “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America....”
1268550098402844679 2020-06-04 10:28:06 -0400 <tedcruz> Congratulations!
1268545626691776513 2020-06-04 10:10:20 -0400 <tedcruz> Objectively speaking, it’s not Trump who’s “burning anything down.”  It’s the violent, looting rioters who are burning our African-American communities. And you’re cheering them on &amp; apologizing for them.
1268390154475110406 2020-06-03 23:52:33 -0400 <tedcruz> Twitter ceo is boycotting the NYT bc they published an opinion he disagrees with?  NYT is reliably left-wing propaganda (eg, revisionist 1619 project) but Twitter is saying “No! Ignore/silence ALL contrary views!”  When Big Tech are more woke, authoritarian censors than NYT....

1268292333134655492 2020-06-03 17:23:50 -0400 <tedcruz> Ben, when Chris Cuomo says: "Please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful,” it’s not fair for you to cite the text of the actual Constitution. How on earth can you expect a CNN “journalist” to know such things?
1268272718576865291 2020-06-03 16:05:54 -0400 <tedcruz> This is WRONG. Dem elected officials need to stop siding with violent criminals who are looting &amp; burning African-American communities, assaulting their fellow citizens &amp; and murdering police officers. #EndTheViolence

1267964235012878336 2020-06-02 19:40:05 -0400 <tedcruz> “Yet despite its violent history, some Democratic leaders have been enablers or outright supporters of the antifa movement....” Worth reading.
1267960863207587840 2020-06-02 19:26:42 -0400 <tedcruz> “During four days of demonstrations, 51 members of the US Park Police were injured; of those, 11 were transported to the hospital and released and three were admitted.”  This is what the media is calling a “PEACEFUL protest.”  https://t.co/jyNcg0kfrh
1267957998493851652 2020-06-02 19:15:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Good bless the NYPD.   Risking their lives right now to try to keep New York safe from violence &amp; looting.
1267956737031712774 2020-06-02 19:10:18 -0400 <tedcruz> Chris, 18 USC 2331 defines “domestic terrorism” as activities that “(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of [U.S.] criminal laws [and]; (B) appear to be intended— (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population....”   That’s EXACTLY what you described.
1267956573198057474 2020-06-02 19:09:39 -0400 <tedcruz> @chrislhayes Chris, 18 USC 2331 defines “domestic terrorism” as activities that “(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of [U.S.] criminal laws [and]; (B) appear to be intended— (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population....”   That’s EXACTLY what you described.
1267953677307961348 2020-06-02 18:58:08 -0400 <tedcruz> Despite your anger &amp; hatred, may God’s blessings be upon you.  (And don’t tweet out fake photo-shopped pictures of Hitler.)
1267951125212299265 2020-06-02 18:48:00 -0400 <tedcruz> .@JoeBiden Why is your staff raising $$ for the people who burned her store?
1267950412453339136 2020-06-02 18:45:10 -0400 <tedcruz> .@Sethrogen LISTEN to her.  Why are you raising $$ for the people who burned her store?  ANTIFA rioting &amp; looting is destroying African-American communities.   Supporting racist violence isn’t woke.  It’s cynical, exploitative &amp; wrong.
1267949479304531968 2020-06-02 18:41:27 -0400 <tedcruz> 🔥🔥Powerful. Watch this.   ANTIFA terrorists &amp; looters pretending they believe “black lives matter”—while they destroy African-American communities.   And Hollywood cheers them on.
1267946141603311616 2020-06-02 18:28:12 -0400 <tedcruz> Chris, have you seen the videos of people being beaten?  Police cars burned?  Macy’s looted?  St. John’s church torched? Cities on fire?  The First Amendment protects Free Speech, but not the right to engage in acts of violence, terror, or assault.
1267941970544070661 2020-06-02 18:11:37 -0400 <tedcruz> 👀👀 I agree with Governor Cuomo. The FIRST job of government is to keep people safe. NYC must stop the violence. Stop the terrorist. Stop the looters.  NOW.
1267931335819243520 2020-06-02 17:29:22 -0400 <tedcruz> What?!? The hard Left lives in a fact-free world. DeBlasio seems oblivious to milllenia of religious persecution. Including the Pilgrims, who helped found our Nation.  And millions of Jews worldwide (whose religious services DeBlasio has had a special fervor in targeting).
1267929628573863937 2020-06-02 17:22:35 -0400 <tedcruz> Hmm....
1267917920144969733 2020-06-02 16:36:03 -0400 <tedcruz> What happened to #GeorgeFloyd was horrific. It was police brutality.   We're united in believing the officers involved should face criminal prosecution.   Yet we see antifa terrorists deciding to take advantage of this crisis to wrongly paint peaceful protestors as being violent.  https://t.co/4mFeQu7bFx
1267907090007437312 2020-06-02 15:53:01 -0400 <tedcruz> Everyone has a right to speak peacefully &amp; exercise the First Amendment.   What you don't have a right to do is engage in violence, loot stores, shatter store windows, or light police cars on fire.  The violence we're seeing across the country is unacceptable. It must be stopped.  https://t.co/CStWMOHvSH

1267840052354310146 2020-06-02 11:26:38 -0400 <tedcruz> Montanans, make sure you drop off your ballot today for my friend Matt Rosendale!
1267833504513101827 2020-06-02 11:00:37 -0400 <tedcruz> Antifa has once again proven that it is a terrorist organization led by hateful radicals. I will convene a hearing of the Constitution Subcommittee in the coming weeks on how we can hold antifa and its members criminally responsible for their violence, rioting, and looting.
1267595997649293313 2020-06-01 19:16:51 -0400 <tedcruz> Kamala &amp; Joe, pls DON’T fundraise to support violent riots. Shouldn’t be partisan.  EVERYBODY should: support peaceful free speech, oppose police brutality AND oppose ANTIFA terrorists who are burning &amp; looting African-American &amp; Hispanic small businesses. Don’t fund violence.
1267331081688231936 2020-06-01 01:44:10 -0400 <tedcruz> A travesty. ANTIFA terrorists hate America.
1267325682847227905 2020-06-01 01:22:43 -0400 <tedcruz> PBS seems to have trouble w/ what words mean. According to Webster’s:  “evidence” - a sign which shows that something exists or is true : indication.  “anarchist” - one who uses violent means to overthrow the established order.  Which part of burning cities &amp; cop cars is unclear?
1267310486439288834 2020-06-01 00:22:20 -0400 <tedcruz> Justin, how about giving your millions to a fund to help the African-American and Hispanic small businesses that are being burned &amp; looted, rather than a fund to bail out the spoiled (often white) ANTIFA terrorists who are destroying minority communities?
1267309566875795456 2020-06-01 00:18:40 -0400 <tedcruz> This is deranged. They are literally burning your city.

1267187865294954498 2020-05-31 16:15:04 -0400 <tedcruz> Lefty Twitter trolls live in an alternative universe. They keep saying “what about KKK”?  IKKK are evil, bigoted terrorists.  Nazis are evil, bigoted terrorists.  ANTIFA are evil, bigoted terrorists.  Don’t kill people or burn cop cars. Don’t be terrorists.  It’s not complicated.
1267184580014018563 2020-05-31 16:02:01 -0400 <tedcruz> Too many of our universities coddle radicals who hate America. This professor is advocating violently burning police stations to the ground. Since he hates capitalism, maybe he should be spared the indignity of drawing a paycheck from a private university funded by capitalists.
1267182785627918337 2020-05-31 15:54:53 -0400 <tedcruz> Important:  “The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.”  https://t.co/A0nLGty7Kh

1266894812944441347 2020-05-30 20:50:35 -0400 <tedcruz> This is bizarre and makes no sense.

1266868058217472007 2020-05-30 19:04:17 -0400 <tedcruz> This is nuts.
1266867205968474119 2020-05-30 19:00:53 -0400 <tedcruz> Read this:  Dem politicians need to stop spreading disinformation.
1266865215267917824 2020-05-30 18:52:59 -0400 <tedcruz> This is powerful.  Watch.
1266863503484366851 2020-05-30 18:46:11 -0400 <tedcruz> Yes.
1266828474691530759 2020-05-30 16:26:59 -0400 <tedcruz> Amen.
1266827636719996929 2020-05-30 16:23:39 -0400 <tedcruz> That’s a terrible way to describe CNN.

1266810307701362690 2020-05-30 15:14:48 -0400 <tedcruz> I agree. Anyone coming from out of state to commit acts of violence, to riot &amp; loot is not helping the cause of justice. This must stop &amp; violent rioters should be prosecuted.
1266808231902543877 2020-05-30 15:06:33 -0400 <tedcruz> I can affirmatively tell you that Obama did not kill JFK.

1266549851493408768 2020-05-29 21:59:50 -0400 <tedcruz> This can’t be true. The media told me there’s no Big Tech bias.
1266535027208335361 2020-05-29 21:00:56 -0400 <tedcruz> Important thread by one of the best foreign policy journalists in the country. What are the odds ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, NYT or WaPo will acknowledge the powerful point Lake makes: that “Gen. Flynn was a Russian operative” narrative was crap from day 1 &amp; those pushing it were lying?
1266532748178722817 2020-05-29 20:51:52 -0400 <tedcruz> If they care about trying to salvage even a shred of journalistic integrity, this is exactly right.

1266451658025902081 2020-05-29 15:29:39 -0400 <tedcruz> Now @BillKristol is in favor of Big Tech censorship. Because Silicon Valley billionaires controlling what speech is &amp; isn’t allowed will work our great for America.   Kristol—who used to be Dan Quayle’s chief of staff—has become so consumed by TDS that he’s unrecognizable.
1266449739886755843 2020-05-29 15:22:02 -0400 <tedcruz> This is stunning, bizarre &amp; wrong. Watch the full video: It is INEXCUSABLE for the police to arrest reporters for doing their job. The @CNN crew acted responsibly during the arrest, but this should have NEVER happened. #FirstAmendment
1266399684379250688 2020-05-29 12:03:07 -0400 <tedcruz> Of course not. They are biased &amp; engaged in one-sided censorship.   To be clear, Twitter shouldn’t be “fact” checking EITHER Biden or Trump. Most politicians (sadly) lie &amp; often 100% of the other side thinks they’re lying.   The political process &amp; Free Speech works this out.
1266397274592219136 2020-05-29 11:53:33 -0400 <tedcruz> Rather than waiting, you could read the law:  International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. §§ 1701 et seq.) and sanctionable activities prohibited by Executive Order 13876 (E.O. 13876).  You can examine the details here:   https://t.co/sWha9AJBRj
1266396370883293184 2020-05-29 11:49:57 -0400 <tedcruz> Of course not. They’re anti-American and anti-Israel. From the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. For Big Tech, that’s a three-fer.
1266386246215110659 2020-05-29 11:09:44 -0400 <tedcruz> Exactly, @AjitPaiFCC. That’s why today I called on AG Barr &amp; @stevenmnuchin1 to open a criminal investigation into @Twitter.
1266383890828218369 2020-05-29 11:00:22 -0400 <tedcruz> 3/x More statutory text:  “It is the policy of the United States...to preserve the vibrant and competitive FREE MARKET that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.”
1266379955325284352 2020-05-29 10:44:44 -0400 <tedcruz> Whatever Dems say is true &amp; must always be true. Even when they lie.
1266372944759947267 2020-05-29 10:16:52 -0400 <tedcruz> Twitter last night...  https://t.co/ZTqJZCDZxV
1266362749560340481 2020-05-29 09:36:22 -0400 <tedcruz> Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), in a letter Friday to the Justice and Treasury departments, is calling for a criminal investigation of Twitter over allegations the company is violating U.S. sanctions against Iran:  https://t.co/UPYQEAIgvO
1266239702803214337 2020-05-29 01:27:25 -0400 <tedcruz> If true, this is...not good.
1266221974109532167 2020-05-29 00:16:58 -0400 <tedcruz> Quick, Twitter, censor this now!
1266221431496507392 2020-05-29 00:14:49 -0400 <tedcruz> Then stop your “attempts to unilateral erode” the First Amendment, and don’t behave like rich, condescending jack-booted thugs.
1266220675531972609 2020-05-29 00:11:48 -0400 <tedcruz> And if a Silicon Valley billionaire decides you’re lying, what should be “the consequence”? #FreeSpeech
1266176243852095489 2020-05-28 21:15:15 -0400 <tedcruz> Neither Facebook nor Twitter should censor political speech.
1266175321700696064 2020-05-28 21:11:35 -0400 <tedcruz> Jake, CNN can be sued for defamation. Why should Twitter be immune?
1266174998236073984 2020-05-28 21:10:18 -0400 <tedcruz> This.
1266174431279362049 2020-05-28 21:08:03 -0400 <tedcruz> Fact check: False. 🤥
1266172964669657093 2020-05-28 21:02:13 -0400 <tedcruz> The PC Left has destroyed the minds of too many young people. College should be about confronting ideas—with which you agree &amp; disagree—and learning how to think critically. This young authoritarian (who can’t explain why) wants the police to ARREST anyone who disagrees with him.
1266127665062436864 2020-05-28 18:02:13 -0400 <tedcruz> This is WRONG. And the auction house should face sanctions for disrespecting the valor of an American hero.
1266126199006396422 2020-05-28 17:56:23 -0400 <tedcruz> Having watched the video, what happened to George Floyd is inexcusable and cannot be tolerated. Law enforcement should protect everyone, regardless of race.  I am glad that the Department of Justice has stepped in, and I pray that justice is done.
1266125527896784896 2020-05-28 17:53:43 -0400 <tedcruz> This is idiotic.

1266119340383969286 2020-05-28 17:29:08 -0400 <tedcruz> This is not a neutral public forum. These are hard-Left authoritarians, silencing Free Speech.  Big Tech billionaires deserve no special immunity from liability from Congress. #EndBigTechCensorship
1266109994929467392 2020-05-28 16:52:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Exactly right.
1266104712455229440 2020-05-28 16:31:01 -0400 <tedcruz> U.S. senators weigh additional sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2.   https://t.co/ezOTJC3DTn
1266102052880551937 2020-05-28 16:20:27 -0400 <tedcruz> Sadly true.
1266091033839927298 2020-05-28 15:36:39 -0400 <tedcruz> Pointing out that “a presumptive ban on homeschooling”—advocated by a Harvard Law prof—would be unconstitutional is not “bullying.” When I was at HLS, that used to be called...law.
1266084188853358592 2020-05-28 15:09:27 -0400 <tedcruz> Harvard Law professor attacks homeschooling, in a bigoted rant calling parents racists &amp; demonizing Christians.   I respond pointing out that banning homeschooling is unconstitutional.   She responds: “We are experiencing bullying in real time!”  Really?  https://t.co/LgtAbLLg71
1266070330071752707 2020-05-28 14:14:23 -0400 <tedcruz> Congrats! @chiproytx Leadership.
1265861200161710094 2020-05-28 00:23:23 -0400 <tedcruz> Yes, you covered him 24/7, which is a big part of how he got elected. Then you covered Russia &amp; the bogus Steele dossier 24/7, which wasted the country’s time for 2 years. Now, the entire media insists on ignoring Obama’s personal involvement in abusing FBI to target Trump.
1265763373758722056 2020-05-27 17:54:39 -0400 <tedcruz> An awesome testament to the dynamism &amp; fundamental strength of the American free enterprise system.

1265711907316682753 2020-05-27 14:30:09 -0400 <tedcruz> I thought that was a reporter’s job?
1265710983940648962 2020-05-27 14:26:29 -0400 <tedcruz> Okay, watch to the end. The anchor snidely makes fun of ordinary Americans. Then the reporter hopelessly throws up his hands when NBC’s hypocrisy is pointed out. Quick...CUT!! Moralizing propaganda is hard! #RulesForTheeAndNotForMe
1265708684853772288 2020-05-27 14:17:20 -0400 <tedcruz> This can’t be true. The case must be a figment of your imagination. Twitter’s “fact” checkers told POTUS there’s no such thing as voter fraud....
1265613749521694723 2020-05-27 08:00:06 -0400 <tedcruz> Don’t miss it!
1265444737324105729 2020-05-26 20:48:30 -0400 <tedcruz> Nothing to see here. Move on....
1265400713162653706 2020-05-26 17:53:34 -0400 <tedcruz> Twitter cancel-culture is absurd. It’s not news (or secret) that Fallon was on SNL 20 yrs ago &amp; that they’ve done edgy comedy. (Eddie Murphy’s 1984 “Mr. White” remains a satirical classic.) Let us know when the following are fired: Jimmy Kimmel, Justin Trudeau &amp; Ralph Northam.

1265374871456034817 2020-05-26 16:10:53 -0400 <tedcruz> Candor:  Dems say they’re “worried” people will get jobs &amp; the economy will rebound.
1265374225189285888 2020-05-26 16:08:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Long overdue:  Google, Facebook and big tech face a long summer of antitrust probes.   https://t.co/8B8V8nBPE4
1265296230281854980 2020-05-26 10:58:24 -0400 <tedcruz> This is very disturbing. Why is Google/YouTube censoring Americans on behalf of the CCP? This is WRONG &amp; Big Tech is drunk with power. The Sherman Act prohibits abusing monopoly power. DOJ needs to stop this NOW.

1264992742821814272 2020-05-25 14:52:26 -0400 <tedcruz> Very true.
1264917465697595393 2020-05-25 09:53:19 -0400 <tedcruz> This #MemorialDay we honor our friends and loved ones who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep us free, as well as the unnamed heroes who lay at rest in our military cemeteries. Although they are gone, they will never be forgotten. #MemorialDay2020  https://t.co/4NqbVFxEUb
1264780762999656449 2020-05-25 00:50:07 -0400 <tedcruz> Wow.  Incredibly powerful.
1264772074226270208 2020-05-25 00:15:35 -0400 <tedcruz> So the the lesson WaPo draws from massive CCP lies &amp; coverup leading directly to a global pandemic and killing over 343,000 people is that America...needs to be nicer to China.
1264759141274464256 2020-05-24 23:24:12 -0400 <tedcruz> Ok, that’s hysterical.
1264726383973896192 2020-05-24 21:14:02 -0400 <tedcruz> Why do today’s Dems hate school choice?  Sadly, they value $$ from teacher union bosses more than education &amp; hope for low-income minority children. This is immoral.
1264683791789981696 2020-05-24 18:24:47 -0400 <tedcruz> On this Memorial Day, we give thanks to the heroic men &amp; women who bravely fought and gave their lives to protect the NYT’s right to call the military Klansmen.   https://t.co/eGGYwkAdbE
1264662175727091714 2020-05-24 16:58:53 -0400 <tedcruz> We urge the Chinese govt to fully appreciate the great sensitivity of 343k people dead because CCP lied &amp; covered up a damn global pandemic. We advise CCP to ditch its illusions &amp; political calculations. We ask CCP not to make any attempt to hide behind a fake red line of lies.
1264294023386353665 2020-05-23 16:35:59 -0400 <tedcruz> Is this the new Dem slogan?

1264065121103613953 2020-05-23 01:26:24 -0400 <tedcruz> Only if by “ourselves” you mean China.
1264038976266080257 2020-05-22 23:42:31 -0400 <tedcruz> It seems she’s deleted the tweet. That’s a step in the right direction, towards recognizing black people (and Hispanics and all Americans) have a right to decide for themselves.  https://t.co/iSMKCMKmZY
1264036376066088961 2020-05-22 23:32:11 -0400 <tedcruz> I’m sorry, why does the NYT (and Joe Biden) think you can dictate what black people are allowed to think?  https://t.co/t9moJibGmE
1264035575180537871 2020-05-22 23:29:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Absolutely right.
1264034968482787328 2020-05-22 23:26:35 -0400 <tedcruz> Why does DeBlasio keep targeting Jews in NYC? This is becoming a pattern, and harassing 10-yr-old kids is never a good look.

1263868822047555584 2020-05-22 12:26:23 -0400 <tedcruz> Why is the Dem solution to everything “let’s empty the jails” and “release all the illegal immigrants”?
1263845943188885506 2020-05-22 10:55:28 -0400 <tedcruz> Even for a journalist, this tweet is lazy. I opposed his nom bc his judicial record was undistinguished &amp; his decision throwing out religious liberty claim was dismissive &amp; poorly reasoned. At the hearing, I walked him thru the opinion line-by-line. Not a smear—advice &amp; consent.
1263842650928615427 2020-05-22 10:42:23 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x More of Biden’s attitude on this subject:   https://t.co/Atr96QM7cI
1263841892829200389 2020-05-22 10:39:22 -0400 <tedcruz> This is the respect that today’s Dems show African Americans.   The other party, the party of Lincoln, welcomes everybody and values you as individuals, free to choose your own faith, your education, your profession, your savings, your life.
1263714364546260993 2020-05-22 02:12:37 -0400 <tedcruz> “Trust me,” Adam Schiff says. Seems confused when voters don’t immediately hand him their ballots and say, “cast them as we should m’Lord.”
1263690709397385216 2020-05-22 00:38:38 -0400 <tedcruz> Shameful.  Senate Dems, tired of threatening Supreme Court Justices, turn to the court of appeals for their partisan campaign of judicial intimidation.
1263689788034551809 2020-05-22 00:34:58 -0400 <tedcruz> Can’t be. Dems have told us there’s no such thing as voter fraud.
1263689059890847746 2020-05-22 00:32:04 -0400 <tedcruz> When this Dem state legislator rightly singled out mail voting as the “greatest source of voter fraud,” he was driven by the long history of fraud in TX Dem primaries, stealing the votes of low-income minorities. Now, Dems nationally have decided that’s a feature, not a bug.
1263657580162879496 2020-05-21 22:26:59 -0400 <tedcruz> City of Denver orders closure of USPS facility that handles mail for ALL of Colorado, Wyoming. If Dems got universal nationwide voting by mail &amp; then they shut down the Post Office this Fall, how exactly does that work?  https://t.co/VLuRN0LVCH
1263622940320546816 2020-05-21 20:09:20 -0400 <tedcruz> Wow. New report that the Biden Center is refusing to disclose its donors.  All its donors—especially foreign donors—should be publicly disclosed.  Most troubling:  Biden Center won’t answer if receives $$ from CCP.
1263615861090406403 2020-05-21 19:41:12 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x Also, Margaret Sanger—founder of Planned Parenthood, Dem’s hero &amp; racist eugenicist—wrote “We should require mandatory sterilizations of those less desirable” &amp; she wrote “We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.“  https://t.co/ArGbdkI8qn
1263608867134615553 2020-05-21 19:13:25 -0400 <tedcruz> The “correction” that reveals the lie at the heart of a pile of lies. Yes, racist George Wallace was a Democrat. KKK founder Nathan Bedford Forrest was a Dem. The authors of Jim Crow were Dems. And Dems today seem not at all concerned about the millions of black children aborted.
1263576832265408516 2020-05-21 17:06:07 -0400 <tedcruz> These bills are part of a larger endeavor to untangle the United States from China’s web and to hold the Chinese government accountable for hiding the truth about #coronavirus from the world and sparking a deadly and devastating pandemic.  https://t.co/IS1Gl5RwtP

1263544254137274368 2020-05-21 14:56:40 -0400 <tedcruz> Dem partisan calls on fed judge to act like a Dem partisan to, euphemistically, “make trouble.”  I don’t recall that being part of the Article III oath.
1263498885298819073 2020-05-21 11:56:23 -0400 <tedcruz> Ted Cruz legislation targets Chinese cover-ups, Hollywood censorship, and CCP propaganda.   https://t.co/uumu60yWhL
1263486539331485697 2020-05-21 11:07:20 -0400 <tedcruz> The media should NOT be asking Silicon Valley billionaires to silence the President of the United States.

1262840515202080768 2020-05-19 16:20:15 -0400 <tedcruz> In Star Trek II (Wrath of Kahn - the best of the series), when Kirk says “by the book” it’s code to mean he’s lying. 🤔🤔
1262824515576508423 2020-05-19 15:16:41 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s probably best for Harvard Law School professors not to draw 100% of their impressions of working-class Americans from elitist stereotypes in the HLS faculty lounge and from watching “dueling banjos” in Deliverance.   https://t.co/FPPRnygQ5A

1262729035362316288 2020-05-19 08:57:17 -0400 <tedcruz> The next time NYC's mayor sends out a gleeful tweet about sending cops after Jews, the DOJ should investigate to make sure he's not violating constitutionally guaranteed religious liberties. Actually, they should have done it after the last one.  https://t.co/BU61pkh27y
1262523424573972480 2020-05-18 19:20:15 -0400 <tedcruz> One more:  UN = commie word police, trying to distract from their being in bed with literal communists.
1262455039773364224 2020-05-18 14:48:31 -0400 <tedcruz> Yup. Not even close.
1262454171489501184 2020-05-18 14:45:04 -0400 <tedcruz> This is today’s objective  journalism. Foppish groupie behavior last seen with Beto.

1262398231281090561 2020-05-18 11:02:47 -0400 <tedcruz> We’ll credit that to their account. They only owe $9.98 trillion more. Plus compensate for 315k lives taken away.
1262395371415834630 2020-05-18 10:51:25 -0400 <tedcruz> Why not lay off the politicians?
1262394278799704069 2020-05-18 10:47:04 -0400 <tedcruz> When they go low, we go high.
1262371343024168963 2020-05-18 09:15:56 -0400 <tedcruz> Uhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor &amp; a 3-star general. He’s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That’s his job. The unmasking was part of outgoing admin launching a massive sting operation to try to entrap him. Maybe this helps: imagine Bush doing same to Obama.

1261770838019366912 2020-05-16 17:29:45 -0400 <tedcruz> This is true only if you refuse to root for America. EVERYONE should celebrate that an infectious disease has not killed our President. This is true even if you disagree w/ his policies or loathe him personally. As the UK experienced, a head of state being deathly ill is tragic.
1261741629637046280 2020-05-16 15:33:41 -0400 <tedcruz> All true.
1261741043298512896 2020-05-16 15:31:21 -0400 <tedcruz> Wow.
1261701893618905089 2020-05-16 12:55:47 -0400 <tedcruz> CNN: we only invite Democrats, just like real college commencement ceremonies.
1261701325525528581 2020-05-16 12:53:31 -0400 <tedcruz> Coincidentally, Pelosi’s new rule on the House proxy voting—send your votes to her &amp; she casts the votes the way she wants—is exactly how she wants to handle everyone’s votes in the November election.   https://t.co/4npENJqwQA
1261700327969116162 2020-05-16 12:49:34 -0400 <tedcruz> Worth reading.   https://t.co/AHVh604LYb
1261696915114164225 2020-05-16 12:36:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Ok, I’m going to use small words so Daily Beast can understand:  Russia really bad. They lie LOTS.  They use RT to lie. When RT looks at CNN (calling a teenager an “expert”) &amp; says “WOW you lie a lot too,” that’s sad. (It’s not like CNN was being brave &amp; exposing Russia or CCP.)
1261694505134284801 2020-05-16 12:26:25 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x This arrogance—not understanding the voters rejected their “America Last” foreign policy &amp; their ruinous economic policy—is what led to them abusing CIA &amp; FBI to target their enemies. Obama &amp; Biden were certain they’re right—voters be damned—and the ends justify the means.
1261693226140000257 2020-05-16 12:21:20 -0400 <tedcruz> DELUSIONAL: Axelrod believes Trump should follow Obama’s advice on who should be National Security Advisor. Voters elected Trump in part bc they DIDN’T want POTUS to send billions to Iran, to weaken our military, to undermine Israel &amp; to refuse to say “radical Islamic terrorism.”
1261523775339757573 2020-05-16 01:08:00 -0400 <tedcruz> READ thread. Am embarrassed my alma mater Harvard Law School is continuing its ignorant, bigoted, radical attack on home schooling. Shows elitist contempt for the millions of amazing Moms &amp; Dads who pour time &amp; love into teaching their kids. HLS shouldn’t ignore the Constitution.
1261476369831247873 2020-05-15 21:59:38 -0400 <tedcruz> When the Russian propaganda network is mocking you as fake news, wow, CNN has issues.

1261455145214201856 2020-05-15 20:35:17 -0400 <tedcruz> A great move. Huawei is nothing more than global espionage operation thinly veiled as a telecom company.
1261397945192083457 2020-05-15 16:48:00 -0400 <tedcruz> I’ve introduced bipartisan legislation to help move America away from our pharmaceutical supply-chain dependence on China &amp; instead partner with our friend Israel on COVID-19 research to find a cure.  https://t.co/yx2P1cc6uW
1261388360544854016 2020-05-15 16:09:55 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s obvious. Packing people in a small metal tube presents no risk of transmission. Running alone on the beach is an imminent public heath hazard.

1260737393839218690 2020-05-13 21:03:12 -0400 <tedcruz> Someone w/ a blue check mark wants China to have a monopoly on rare-earth minerals (essential for national defense) &amp; the US to remain dependent on China. I look him up. He was—of course—Mexico’s ambassador to China, now a DC lobbyist. Anyone wanna bet he’s being paid $$ by CCP?
1260726278682030087 2020-05-13 20:19:02 -0400 <tedcruz> TWO Biden falsehoods revealed in 24 hours. First, he tell ABC he knew nothing about Obama targeting Gen. Flynn. George STEPHANOPOLOUS calls him out &amp; Biden backtracks. Second, Biden says “that’s ALL I know about it.” Also FALSE—revealed today Biden personally unmasked Flynn.
1260724005633495040 2020-05-13 20:10:00 -0400 <tedcruz> We must stop our dependence on China. NOW.  https://t.co/dG1zAXuquw
1260723373686042631 2020-05-13 20:07:30 -0400 <tedcruz> Biden campaign so concerned about today’s bombshell that Biden personally unmasked Gen. Flynn—just days before Trump was sworn in—that now they’re blasting CBS as “right wing”!!  Jake Tapper rightly calls Biden out.   https://t.co/Rg04MIpLSW
1260721914361917442 2020-05-13 20:01:42 -0400 <tedcruz> ESPN leaving Hakeem Olajuwon off their top 10 is indefensible.   https://t.co/6hJlKm0i5J
1260665468135882755 2020-05-13 16:17:24 -0400 <tedcruz> Stunning:  Biden, just days before leaving office, personally directed the unmasking of Gen. Michael Flynn, the incoming National Security Advisor. Unprecedented politicization of intelligence &amp; law enforcement. Of course, MSM will ignore.
1260637435169574914 2020-05-13 14:26:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Dems $3T “stimulus” bill uses word “cannabis” 68 times (more than the word “jobs.”  Not terribly surprising, since we know smoking pot can make you repeat yourself....  https://t.co/u6drdBTqZh

1259156209845907457 2020-05-09 12:20:09 -0400 <tedcruz> 3/x “Here's a direct quote from the draft interview memo. ‘FLYNN stated it was possible that he talked to KISLYAK on the issue, but if he did, he did not remember doing so.’” That's NOT remotely perjury. This was a partisan charade from outset, politically setting up Gen Flynn.
1259155763651633153 2020-05-09 12:18:22 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x “The FBI agents who interviewed Flynn indicated...that Flynn did not directly deny talking to Kislyak about sanctions, as he was accused by Mueller. Instead they noted he couldn't remember, wasn't sure and even conceded it was possible.”

1258768552552738816 2020-05-08 10:39:44 -0400 <tedcruz> You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.  https://t.co/Y9TK3RFOs7

1258757954460942337 2020-05-08 09:57:37 -0400 <tedcruz> Why stop there? Why only $2k/month? And why exclude non-citizens or non-Americans? Why not send $100k/month, every month, to every person on earth? And also prohibit any of them from working. In the magical world of free-money socialists, why, exactly, wouldn’t that work? 🤔
1258725794958004225 2020-05-08 07:49:50 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s not complicated. Censorship is bad. The Chinese Communist Party is bad. Artistic integrity matters. Truth matters. Freddy Mercury was gay &amp; you can’t tell his story while censoring that fact.  And Hollywood should not sell out free speech for $$.
1258722470598717441 2020-05-08 07:36:37 -0400 <tedcruz> NBC is corrupt. They don’t care that you know it.
1258720850695671808 2020-05-08 07:30:11 -0400 <tedcruz> THANK YOU Bill Barr for defending rule of law. Obama DOJ &amp; FBI were tragically politicized &amp; weaponized. As notes reveal, was a partisan investigation into Flynn, trying to entrap him or “get him fired.” It takes COURAGE for AG to demand accountability, knowing the press frenzy.
1258549973999706112 2020-05-07 20:11:11 -0400 <tedcruz> Powerful. Inspirational. God bless Shelley and God bless the Texas Supreme Court for standing up for Liberty and common sense. #ThisIsTexas

1258472679906123778 2020-05-07 15:04:02 -0400 <tedcruz> Awesome.
1258464008350380032 2020-05-07 14:29:35 -0400 <tedcruz> This is NUTS.

1257500475844448259 2020-05-04 22:40:51 -0400 <tedcruz> How about we cancel taxes?
1257409726347952133 2020-05-04 16:40:14 -0400 <tedcruz> 6/x The NYT &amp; Pulitzer are now both expressly partisan, consumed with Trump-hatred, history “reframing,” race-baiting, dishonest propagandists. Denounced by serious historians. It’s truly sad. Now, more than ever, we need real journalists. And they’re not even pretending anymore.

1257407721441300481 2020-05-04 16:32:16 -0400 <tedcruz> 3/x NYT Executive Editor Dean Baquet was caught in a leaked transcript admitting it blatantly political: “We built our newsroom to cover one story [Russia collusion] &amp; we did it truly well. Now we have to regroup, and shift resources and emphasis to take on a different story.”
1257405622812884992 2020-05-04 16:23:56 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x NYT: "[America’s] founding ideals were false when they were written." "The US is a nation founded on both an ideal &amp; a lie." "[O]ne of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare independence was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery." ALL FALSE.
1257405265793757184 2020-05-04 16:22:31 -0400 <tedcruz> Pulitzer epically beclowns itself. Prize supposed to go to work that “adheres to the highest journalistic principles.” NYT’s 1619 project is explicitly not journalism; it is propaganda. In NYT’s words: “It aims to REFRAME OUR COUNTRY’S HISTORY.” It’s based on FALSE premises. 1/x
1257154584742682625 2020-05-03 23:46:24 -0400 <tedcruz> They are Dem hacks, not journalists. Imagine this NYT editorial:  “allegations have arisen that President Nixon was behind the break-in at the Watergate. The media cannot investigate. We believe the Committee to Re-Elect the President should launch a ‘thorough’ investigation.”
1257153541736747009 2020-05-03 23:42:15 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s who they are. They don’t even pretend anymore.
1257056003276918786 2020-05-03 17:14:40 -0400 <tedcruz> Amazing Freudian slip from NYT.  It’s the same principle as Bloomberg media saying “we won’t investigate Mike Bloomberg as a candidate, because he’s our boss.”
1257054402847944704 2020-05-03 17:08:19 -0400 <tedcruz> There’s a hierarchy in Leftist values. #1: Trump BAD. #2: Must defend Chinese communists. Apparently, both 1 &amp; 2 are more important to the Left than free speech, artistic expression, or gay rights. Why not support free speech, art, telling truth &amp; civil rights for everyone?
1257045684995448834 2020-05-03 16:33:40 -0400 <tedcruz> Puppies 🐶🐶 &gt; murder hornets 🐝🐝
1257040659883724800 2020-05-03 16:13:42 -0400 <tedcruz> This should be a wake up call for anyone who still defends China. The Chinese Communist Party engaged in a global coverup endangering millions &amp; they have blood on their hands.   China is the greatest geopolitical threat facing the US for the next century. We need to act like it.
1257040354852966401 2020-05-03 16:12:29 -0400 <tedcruz> Horrifying. US intel confirms the Chinese Communist Party knew at the highest levels the #CoronavirusOutbreak would turn into a global pandemic, so much so that they secretly changed their policies to stockpile medical equipment &amp; hide imports/exports.  https://t.co/JuOld7kloe

1256320387308126208 2020-05-01 16:31:36 -0400 <tedcruz> Insanity.
1256269904560472065 2020-05-01 13:11:00 -0400 <tedcruz> @AndrewTKnudsen Yours is an argument that the virus wasn’t bio-engineered—ie, created in a lab. I have no reason to doubt that. What the circumstantial evidence suggests—which needs to be vigorously investigated—is that the labs were studying this (natural) virus &amp; it accidentally escaped.
1256265766615363586 2020-05-01 12:54:33 -0400 <tedcruz> Why is Obama’s former Deputy National Security Advisor apologizing for the Chinese communist govt &amp; denying their responsibility for this global pandemic?  Here’s a detailed thread rebutting this laughable WaPo “fact check”:  https://t.co/YYyuttioP2
1256264988769091585 2020-05-01 12:51:28 -0400 <tedcruz> 10/x And is it relevant that WaPo is owned by Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, who stands to make billions in China if he pleases the communist overlords? Whatever WaPo is doing, this is NOT journalism. It is apologizing for the CCP, trying to cover up their culpability.
1256263965904166913 2020-05-01 12:47:24 -0400 <tedcruz> 9/x ...source, Dr. Daszak? Well, his organization, “EcoHealth Alliance” was receiving (now cancelled) US taxpayer $$ to support bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology! Why does WaPo NOT disclose his enormous bias, litigation exposure &amp; conflict of interest??
1256262796003639301 2020-05-01 12:42:45 -0400 <tedcruz> 8/x That’s it. Those two counter-facts form 100% of the basis for WaPo’s “fact check.” And #2, the claim that “China’s been incredibly open,” is laughably absurd. They DESTROYED THE LAB SAMPLES. They PUNISHED &amp; SILENCED the pandemic whistleblowers. And who is this objective...
1256261867833622530 2020-05-01 12:39:04 -0400 <tedcruz> 7/x WaPo COUNTER-FACT TWO: They quote Dr. Peter Daszak, the head of “EcoHealth Alliance” as saying “China’s been incredibly open. I believe it’s because it’s a scientific collaboration &amp; in China they’re really proud of their science; they do good work, especially in virology.”
1256260219463761920 2020-05-01 12:32:31 -0400 <tedcruz> 6/x...basis? WaPo COUNTER-FACT ONE: The CCP and the lab director (who initially wrote “could [the pandemic virus] have come from our lab?”) now deny it. “Shi, her team &amp; the Chinese govt have adamantly denied that it could have come from this lab.” WaPa takes that denial as true.
1256258615629033474 2020-05-01 12:26:08 -0400 <tedcruz> 5/x...conclusion? “The balance of scientific evidence strongly suggest the conclusion that the new coronavirus emerged from nature, be it in the Wuhan market or somewhere else.” This is a non sequitur. None of the aforementioned evidence leads to that conclusion. What’s WaPo’s...
1256257573969428482 2020-05-01 12:22:00 -0400 <tedcruz> 4/x ...that they were afraid what the samples, if examined, would show.  ALL OF THESE FACTS strongly suggest the virus escaped from one of these CCP labs. At this point, the evidence is circumstantial (because the CCP is hiding/blocking any direct evidence). BUT what is WaPo’s...
1256256458750132231 2020-05-01 12:17:34 -0400 <tedcruz> 3/x ...safety concerns, resulting in multiple US Dept wires—before this crisis—warning that shoddy safety protocols could lead to a global coronavirus pandemic.  FACT 4: WaPo admits China DESTROYED the lab samples after the pandemic started (raising the natural inference...
1256254020311801857 2020-05-01 12:07:53 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x FACT 1: WaPo admits two separate labs in Wuhan were studying coronaviruses derived from bats. One lab was just 300 yards from Wuhan wet market. FACT 2: WaPo admits bats with similar coronaviruses “live in caves 1000 miles away.” FACT 3: WaPo admits both labs had SERIOUS...
1256252575176970240 2020-05-01 12:02:08 -0400 <tedcruz> 1/x “Amazing” is definitely right word for this video. WaPo “abandoning all pretenses of journalism to produce CCP propaganda” would be another way to put it. If this reporter submitted this video in a freshman logic class, it wouldn’t receive a passing grade. Let’s review facts.

1254533896160641024 2020-04-26 18:12:43 -0400 <tedcruz> @GeorgeM16700156 Agree. This thread began by my RT’ing an article about John Ioannidas.

1254528320550645760 2020-04-26 17:50:34 -0400 <tedcruz> 4/x Our goal should be protecting as many lives as possible, both from COVID-19 AND from crushing poverty &amp; unemployment. We should value lives on both sides on the ledger, and not let angry partisan politics drive our responses to this crisis.
1254527731045449730 2020-04-26 17:48:13 -0400 <tedcruz> 3/x ...and the Admin is working hard (albeit imperfectly) to combat it. We should continue to work to slow the spread of the virus, w/o giving in to hysteria. And we must get as many people back to work as soon as humanly possible—varying geographically based on medical facts.
1254526946836451328 2020-04-26 17:45:06 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x And too many who love Trump are too quick to dismiss the pandemic as purely media-driven (“hydroxychloroquine will cure it’s all!”) &amp; say everyone must go back to work NOW. If we are being fair &amp; reasonable, NEITHER view makes much sense.  Trump didn’t create this virus....
1254525802563207170 2020-04-26 17:40:33 -0400 <tedcruz> Very much worth reading. In dealing w/ this pandemic, we need to be driven by science, facts &amp; common sense. Far too many—on both sides of the aisle—view this crisis through a political lens. For many who hate Trump, the virus is all his fault &amp; we must shut EVERYTHING down. 1/x
1254251059746308102 2020-04-25 23:28:50 -0400 <tedcruz> Ridiculous. Who would have predicted California would declare war on skaters AND surfers?

1253723666543755265 2020-04-24 12:33:09 -0400 <tedcruz> So, the co’s that Harvard will now not invest in (or divest from) presumably include: oil &amp; gas; coal; electricity (other than pure wind &amp; solar); EVERY car company; ALL airplanes &amp; air travel; ALL trains; ALL trucking; ALL steel; UPS &amp; FedEx; Amazon &amp; ANY Tech that delivers....
1253679780878319619 2020-04-24 09:38:46 -0400 <tedcruz> Well, if Harvard is going to actively work to destroy American jobs, it seems to me the federal government should redirect those funds elsewhere:  https://t.co/iYONpYHR51
1253679779766849536 2020-04-24 09:38:46 -0400 <tedcruz> At the same time it’s using its vast resources to try to bully the American economy, Harvard happily takes over $600mm in federal funding each year for research.
1253679778487570433 2020-04-24 09:38:46 -0400 <tedcruz> This is wrong, cynical, elitist, and cruel. It’s virtue signaling for the rich &amp; powerful, at the expense of blue-collar America.
1253679777510297600 2020-04-24 09:38:45 -0400 <tedcruz> And, notably, Harvard’s commitment to climate change conveniently doesn’t include divesting from investments in China, even though China is the #1 greenhouse gas emitter in the world.
1253679776621002753 2020-04-24 09:38:45 -0400 <tedcruz> As blue-collar jobs are being destroyed by the millions across the nation, rich liberals are implementing policies to destroy even more working-class jobs.   And, Harvard wants to use its clout to cause other institutions to dry up even more capital.
1253679775698366464 2020-04-24 09:38:45 -0400 <tedcruz> So, the day after being publicly shamed into not taking $9mm in taxpayer “relief” funds, Harvard details its new policy to try to use its $41bn endowment to hammer American jobs and defund energy, automobiles, airlines, construction &amp; manufacturing:  https://t.co/iYONpYHR51

1252813627435831296 2020-04-22 00:16:59 -0400 <tedcruz> Absurd:  The WHO shamelessly broadcasts Chinese communist propaganda, and now YouTube is saying it will censor anything contrary to the WHO. The CCP shouldn’t be running Silicon Valley, or trampling free speech in America.
1252808284433797120 2020-04-21 23:55:45 -0400 <tedcruz> Of course they should give it back. Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world, $41 Bn. They shouldn’t have taken taxpayer “relief” in the first place.
1252770161783947264 2020-04-21 21:24:16 -0400 <tedcruz> Exactly right.

1252295115063820288 2020-04-20 13:56:36 -0400 <tedcruz> This is twisted. Here’s a crazy idea: at this time of global pandemic, let’s not wish for anyone’s death, even if we happen to disagree with them politically.
1252075440434565121 2020-04-19 23:23:42 -0400 <tedcruz> This is ridiculous. Taxpayer relief funds should go to those in real need. Harvard University has a $41bn endowment—the largest in the world. Put another way, Harvard’s endowment is $13mm per student, or $171mm per faculty member.

You want to enforce social distancing in public spaces, fine, but filling a skate park with sand—so nobody can use it—is authoritarian abuse of power.
1251746809908690944 2020-04-19 01:37:50 -0400 <tedcruz> Clearly, the greatest public- heath threat imaginable...a kid on a skateboard.  Young people, remember, this is what Big-government statist Democrats do—they take away your freedom.
1251688985312792579 2020-04-18 21:48:04 -0400 <tedcruz> At the same time that Harvard—w/ a $41bn endowment—indefensibly gets $9mm in taxpayer-funded coronavirus “relief,” they publish a cover story attacking home-schooling &amp; people of faith.

The Mayor’s decision is stunning. And it is, ‘beyond all reason,’ unconstitutional.”

1249036162381025281 2020-04-11 14:06:41 -0400 <tedcruz> Important @billmaher rant on the culpability of the Chinese Communist govt for the Wuhan pandemic. And on the need to close wet markets NOW.  Strong language, but he’s one of very few in Hollywood willing to call out the CCP.

1248813146007109635 2020-04-10 23:20:30 -0400 <tedcruz> Imagine: you’re a professional NPR reporter, you have an opportunity to ask the US Surgeon General a Q—in the midst of a global pandemic w/ over 100k fatalities—and you ask “‘many people’ are offended by what you call your grandmother.” Seriously, what the hell is wrong w/ MSM?!?
1248808395957829632 2020-04-10 23:01:37 -0400 <tedcruz> When Dem officeholders are sworn in, do they issue jack boots at that time, or do they arrive later in the mail? #StopPersecutingFaith
1248807674071916548 2020-04-10 22:58:45 -0400 <tedcruz> More absurdity:  Fort Worth Star-Telegram urges that ALL golf courses be closed. NEWS FLASH: if you’re not able to play golf at least 6 feet away from everyone else, you’re doing it wrong....  https://t.co/LOX0p3BfvV
1248804042463227904 2020-04-10 22:44:20 -0400 <tedcruz> This is ABSURD.  Unless there are very different facts than reported here, these tickets were an unconstitutional abuse of power.

1248274231240114176 2020-04-09 11:39:03 -0400 <tedcruz> This story is absolutely heartbreaking. Heidi’s &amp; my prayers are with the McKean family and the entire extended Kennedy family.

1247737886679740416 2020-04-08 00:07:48 -0400 <tedcruz> For a sitting Dem senator to be openly cheering for Saudi Arabia to bankrupt thousands of US energy producers, unemploy millions of Americans, and profit to the tune of billions—even in today’s angry partisan Left—is just remarkable. And sad.

1246879637680119809 2020-04-05 15:17:26 -0400 <tedcruz> This is absurd. To Dem politicians (and it seems to be only Dems doing this, eg Wolf in PA, DeBlasio in NYC, Cooper in NC), protect public safety, but WE DON’T LIVE IN A POLICE STATE.

If NC deems abortion “essential,” then pregnancy care services are as well. This is WRONG; Governor Cooper should be ashamed. 1/x

It’s past time to pass term limits; the overwhelming majority of Americans (Republicans, Democrats &amp; Independents) support it, and it’s just career politicians who oppose it. #TermLimitsNow
1233188866762444802 2020-02-27 19:35:12 -0400 <tedcruz> Seems like everyone’s got a podcast these days
1233180508911218688 2020-02-27 19:01:59 -0400 <tedcruz> Um, under the Trump Administration, we did, rightly, halt commercial air travel to and from China — the exact opposite policy from Obama’s.

1233130604436369409 2020-02-27 15:43:41 -0400 <tedcruz> As you are speaking as the oracle of science, tell us, what exactly is a Y chromosome?
1233123881789071360 2020-02-27 15:16:58 -0400 <tedcruz> How exactly would open borders protect us from the potential spread of a worldwide pandemic?

1233072147490385923 2020-02-27 11:51:23 -0400 <tedcruz> Wow.  WATCH this video. Sobering &amp; incredibly dangerous.  We need to do everything possible to contain this virus and protect human life.
1232769483976183808 2020-02-26 15:48:43 -0400 <tedcruz> Excited to return to @CPAC tomorrow!  Tune in for my conversation with @michaeljknowles &amp; @GOPChairwoman Ronna McDaniel at ~1:00PM ET.  https://t.co/x5BDL5zaUa

1232716145976860672 2020-02-26 12:16:46 -0400 <tedcruz> Macaulay Culkin joins the cast of American Horror Story.  Brings a totally new meaning to “Home Alone.”
1232715186051653633 2020-02-26 12:12:57 -0400 <tedcruz> Am proud to be leading this fight. Right now, ZERO Dem senators support Term Linits. @TomSteyer has bankrolled most of them—maybe he could start by convincing even ONE Dem senator to listen to the People and support Term Limits?
1232714795385839616 2020-02-26 12:11:24 -0400 <tedcruz> Am proud to be leading this fight. Right now, ZERO Dem senators support Term Linits. @TomSteyer has bankrolled most of them—maybe he could start by convincing even ONE Dem senator to listen to the People and support Term Limits?
1232713329136799750 2020-02-26 12:05:35 -0400 <tedcruz> Stacey Abrams announced she already won the SCOTUS nomination last year.
1232697815182249985 2020-02-26 11:03:56 -0400 <tedcruz> Constitutional amendment, in fact... would more than welcome the support of my colleagues on this!
1232362143334436866 2020-02-25 12:50:05 -0400 <tedcruz> That can’t be true. Surely the MSM would have told us that....
1232174460414894080 2020-02-25 00:24:18 -0400 <tedcruz> They don’t worry that he is a communist. Nor that he glorifies communists or likes to pal around with them. Nope, the fear is Republicans will “pounce on it.” How ‘bout this: Stalin, Mao, Castro &amp; Pol Pot we’re all horrible, murderous tyrants &amp; anyone saying otherwise is lying.
1232173240161898496 2020-02-25 00:19:27 -0400 <tedcruz> To all the folks who said Andrew Jackson: really strong choice. Old Hickory would be ferocious in a street fight.
1232172889526472704 2020-02-25 00:18:04 -0400 <tedcruz> Are you sad to see people who love America?
1232172420515188738 2020-02-25 00:16:12 -0400 <tedcruz> Chicken curry is delicious!
1232093228125556737 2020-02-24 19:01:31 -0400 <tedcruz> @JesseKellyDC George Washington. Legendary soldier, endured incredible hardships, and led America to an impossible military victory over the mightiest army on earth. A bad ass in every sense of the term.
1231999639810867201 2020-02-24 12:49:38 -0400 <tedcruz> More than a little odd that “American” doesn’t make the list. Wonder why?  She is a sitting member of the US Congress. But, in today’s Leftist world of intersectionality, “American” is deemed embarrassing &amp; gauche.
1231996994031378434 2020-02-24 12:39:07 -0400 <tedcruz> Maybe stop giving them needles that they leave en masse in public parks? And refusing to prosecute them when they engage in theft or vandalism? How ‘bout drug treatment programs instead?
1231996492057063427 2020-02-24 12:37:07 -0400 <tedcruz> This is the Leftist mind: write a slip of paper &amp; a house will magically appear. Never mind that the person doesn’t have a job, the contractor can’t get a CA permit to build the house, rent control has caused a housing shortage &amp; homeless people are crapping on the doorstep. 🤡
1231975653383299073 2020-02-24 11:14:19 -0400 <tedcruz> This is wrong. This is cowardly. This is disgusting.   This is something every single one of my colleagues in Congress should be able to agree upon -- that Israeli children should not have to live their lives in fear of terrorist rockets raining down on them.
1231974401685512192 2020-02-24 11:09:20 -0400 <tedcruz> In Congressional District 6 in Illinois, I am proud to offer my endorsement and support to @JeanneIves, and I am asking you to join me in supporting her:  https://t.co/cLRqqVQnu3 #IL06
1231762113141649408 2020-02-23 21:05:47 -0400 <tedcruz> It really makes a difference when those you murder at the firing squad can read &amp; write.
1231454594779185152 2020-02-23 00:43:49 -0400 <tedcruz> This is the Democratic front runner.
1231449193010647041 2020-02-23 00:22:21 -0400 <tedcruz> Talk about his hands.
1231446917948887041 2020-02-23 00:13:19 -0400 <tedcruz> Even for MSNBC, this is deranged.
1231417449028911105 2020-02-22 22:16:13 -0400 <tedcruz> Yang is right: This is the most fundamental political shift of the past decade.  The Democratic Party has abandoned the working class, has abandoned union members, and the GOP has become the blue-collar party of jobs.
1231414726934048769 2020-02-22 22:05:24 -0400 <tedcruz> Me too.
1230592534256275457 2020-02-20 15:38:18 -0400 <tedcruz> April 2 is the premier of Steph Curry’s powerful, inspirational  movie about Kenny Sailors—the inventor of the modern jump shot.  @jimmykimmel and I could both learn something from it!   https://t.co/n6xp6IxaYe
1230219998477651974 2020-02-19 14:57:58 -0400 <tedcruz> Trump.
1230219712111501321 2020-02-19 14:56:50 -0400 <tedcruz> This view makes no sense. Do you object when a student uses a Pell grant to attend Norte Dame? Or the GI Bill to go to BYU? If it’s OK for 18-yr-olds, why not 17-yr-olds? Don’t discriminate against religious faith—which is what the Supreme Court will hold—and let students decide.
1230139952819851266 2020-02-19 09:39:54 -0400 <tedcruz> What utter nonsense. Its NAME is “Bloomberg News.” He literally owns it. There is no stronger supporter of Israel or foe of antisemitism in the Senate; instead get the House to pass my resolution (passed Senate 100-0) calling out Left-wing antisemitic comments of your colleagues.
1229920320003485697 2020-02-18 19:07:09 -0400 <tedcruz> Neither do any of the other 2020 Dems. Can’t let real people’s lives get in the way of their extremist ideology.
1229919334539186177 2020-02-18 19:03:14 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s almost as if he owns the media.
1229900028484956160 2020-02-18 17:46:31 -0400 <tedcruz> Since they’re standing next to you on the Dem debate stage, you won’t have to go far....
1229899599630012416 2020-02-18 17:44:49 -0400 <tedcruz> Um, kinda a problem....  https://t.co/qhqVyUT5zJ
1229885137447419905 2020-02-18 16:47:21 -0400 <tedcruz> Yup, weakening our military would make China, Russia, Iran &amp; North Korea all very, very happy. And what possibly could go wrong?

1229824120927539200 2020-02-18 12:44:54 -0400 <tedcruz> 👀
1229655245258657792 2020-02-18 01:33:51 -0400 <tedcruz> I will admit, both politicians and the the media are experts at spreading manure.
1229653042234118144 2020-02-18 01:25:05 -0400 <tedcruz> It takes incredible faith to look at the beauty &amp; grandeur of all creation and assert that you know for a fact that there is no Creator.
1229652591606403072 2020-02-18 01:23:18 -0400 <tedcruz> And of the 10 richest men in America, SEVEN—Buffett, Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Bloomberg, Page &amp; Brin—are Democrats funding today’s Dems &amp; “socialists.”  Not coincidentally, massive govt power consistently PRESERVES massive wealth and PREVENTS new people from acquiring wealth.
1229649424504279040 2020-02-18 01:10:43 -0400 <tedcruz> Way to ignore the substance, big guy. ZERO Senate Dems support term limits. Your billions keep them in office.  If you believe what you say you do, why doesn’t your party?
1229647440111783937 2020-02-18 01:02:50 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x Now you’re retweeting ad hominems from Mazie Hirono. Everyone expects that from her—that’s who she is—but you were a real academic. Trump has broken the Left. To see you reduced to a Twitter troll is just sad. Disagree on substance, on the Const, but you’re better than this.
1229645428003659776 2020-02-18 00:54:50 -0400 <tedcruz> .@tribelaw I tried to DM you privately, but Twitter said you had blocked it. Hard to think of something more fitting to show a closed mind. You were my Con Law professor in law school. I enjoyed your class. You were always political &amp; leaned Left, but you were a good prof. 1/x
1229642095650115584 2020-02-18 00:41:35 -0400 <tedcruz> This is Bernie’s base—the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool &amp; they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote:  facts, truth &amp; substance.
1229631510489075713 2020-02-17 23:59:32 -0400 <tedcruz> 5/x ...(4) yes, every adult—man or woman—has a right to do whatever you want with your body...but that doesn’t mean you have a right to do something harmful to ANOTHER person’s body. Leftists refuse to admit that an unborn child is a separate human being whose life is precious.
1229630628683014147 2020-02-17 23:56:01 -0400 <tedcruz> 4/x ...unite all of us, regardless of our views on voluntarily abortion, Senate Dems refused to condemn China’s FORCED abortions. And...
1229630074560950272 2020-02-17 23:53:49 -0400 <tedcruz> 3/x (3) That mistaken world-view finds fruition in communist China’s “one child” policy, which has forced millions of mothers to abort their children against their will. When I introduced an amendment against China’s barbaric policy of forced abortion—something that should...
1229629258793963521 2020-02-17 23:50:35 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x (2) That mistaken belief has led to horrific policies of forced sterilization of those deemed “unfit” — policies that the Supreme Court tragically (and wrongly) upheld in Buck v. Bell (1927).
1229628275988844544 2020-02-17 23:46:41 -0400 <tedcruz> It’s been a sight to behold the last 24 hours of Lefties triggering over this tweet. “Ah ha! You’re pro choice,” they exclaim. No, I believe in BOTH life and individual liberty. Four points: (1) Too many on the Left believe the Malthusian nonsense that more children are bad. 1/x
1229548821564329991 2020-02-17 18:30:57 -0400 <tedcruz> Here’s a crazy notion:  139 arrests is too damn many. Dems, stop releasing dangerous criminals onto our streets!  https://t.co/bwOZf7VNa6
1229547733461143552 2020-02-17 18:26:38 -0400 <tedcruz> Damn straight.
1229495425687867393 2020-02-17 14:58:47 -0400 <tedcruz> Hey @TomSteyer I’m the author of a constl amendment to mandate Term Limits for all members of Congress. Overwhelming majority of Americans support, but right now ZERO Dem senators. Maybe you could try to convince even ONE Dem senator to listen to the People &amp; support term linits?
1229473799994826755 2020-02-17 13:32:51 -0400 <tedcruz> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sanders was one of only two senators to skip the vote, with Ed Markey (D., Mass.) also absent. Sanders's fellow 2020 presidential candidates in the Senate, Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), attended and voted "nay" on the amendment, which passed 64 to 34
1229473639650779136 2020-02-17 13:32:12 -0400 <tedcruz> All 53 Republicans, 10 Dems &amp; Independent Angus King supported the amendment introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz. It expressly praised @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, who ordered the strike that took out the terrorist leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  https://t.co/PCaIhLOcCz
1229215451609169921 2020-02-16 20:26:16 -0400 <tedcruz> Congrats!
1229054383540887555 2020-02-16 09:46:14 -0400 <tedcruz> Yikes.  A government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything...literally! Alabama Democrat proposes bill mandating all men have vasectomy at age 50 or after third child.  https://t.co/PeaNUg1Joc
1229053341554049024 2020-02-16 09:42:05 -0400 <tedcruz> Good Q.
1229052758529126400 2020-02-16 09:39:46 -0400 <tedcruz> Kinda a mess.
1228861565182631940 2020-02-15 21:00:02 -0400 <tedcruz> Sam Donaldson endorses Bloomberg because...media is so nonpartisan. Bloomberg calls Donaldson “legendary.”  🤣 Donaldson’s most “legendary” moment was teeing up Reagan for the greatest presidential press-conference response in history. WATCH:   https://t.co/grRZk091l9

1228450140417118210 2020-02-14 17:45:11 -0400 <tedcruz> Um, nobody in Texas says that. Ever.  Translation: “somebody told me that lots of people in ‘fly-over country’ have animals. Let me try to say something folksy about animals so the yokels will think I can relate....”

1228313330428846080 2020-02-14 08:41:33 -0400 <tedcruz> Does seem rather undemocratic.
1228313069929074688 2020-02-14 08:40:31 -0400 <tedcruz> VA House votes to give all of Virginia’s votes to California &amp; New York. Because that’s definitely in the interest of Virginians. Jefferson &amp; Madison would be appalled.

1227941018869358592 2020-02-13 08:02:07 -0400 <tedcruz> A fair Q. Doubt they’ll answer it.

1227619997025001472 2020-02-12 10:46:30 -0400 <tedcruz> FACT you will NEVER see on the 6 o’clock news: U.S. emissions FELL 2.9%, or by 140 million tons, continuing the trend of the United States LEADING THE WORLD IN TOTAL EMISSIONS DECLINE since 2000.

1226930140543963136 2020-02-10 13:05:15 -0400 <tedcruz> 6/x MLK: “...Never succumb to the temptation of becoming bitter. As you press on for justice, be sure to move with dignity and discipline, using only the weapon of love. Let no man pull you so low as to hate him. Always avoid violence.”

1226928838317420544 2020-02-10 13:00:04 -0400 <tedcruz> 4/x Here’s how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. put it in 1956, “The Christian owes his ultimate allegiance to God, and if any earthly institution conflicts with God's will it is your Christian duty to take a stand against it.”
1226928412205473797 2020-02-10 12:58:23 -0400 <tedcruz> 3/x “... to add the more distinguished character of Christian.” This devotion to God AND country inspired the Declaration of Independence (“We hold these truths to be self-evident....”); gave force to the mighty Abolitionists; and drove the civil rights movement.
1226925347419164672 2020-02-10 12:46:12 -0400 <tedcruz> 2/x George Washington wrote in 1778, “While we are zealously performing the duties of good citizens &amp; soldiers, we certainly ought not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion.

1226924993143025666 2020-02-10 12:44:48 -0400 <tedcruz> Rep. Omar seems confused and/or dismayed by my being a Christian. Perhaps some history might help; the sentiment I expressed goes back to the very founding of our Nation.  Indeed, the motto of the American Legion is “for God and country.” 1/x

1220098330237206535 2020-01-22 16:38:04 -0400 <tedcruz> I agree, Military Aid to Ukraine is vital.   The Trump administration gave lethal defensive aid to Ukraine. They sent javelin missiles to take out Russian tanks. The Obama administration? They sent teddy bears and MREs.  Should President Obama have been impeached?
1220079985895137285 2020-01-22 15:25:11 -0400 <tedcruz> A reminder of what this is all about: any president -- any administration -- is justified in investigating corruption.   And there was serious evidence of real corruption concerning Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma.

1219747907030650881 2020-01-21 17:25:37 -0400 <tedcruz> Dems suggest that Trump’s lawyer shouldn’t take part in the impeachment trial. Ted Cruz fires back:  https://t.co/FbnfPgAB5b

1219694084748644353 2020-01-21 13:51:45 -0400 <tedcruz> NEWSFLASH for Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff: @realDonaldTrump invoking Constitutional privilege is not obstruction of Congress.  If it were, nearly every president would have committed impeachable conduct.  https://t.co/lWeV32MxWH
1219675730642198528 2020-01-21 12:38:49 -0400 <tedcruz>  https://t.co/kVvmn0rxTg
1219664844716236800 2020-01-21 11:55:33 -0400 <tedcruz> So, maybe we should disqualify Schiff as a lawyer, and schedule him instead as a witness to explain his role in creating the "evidence" in this proceeding?
1219664843395010560 2020-01-21 11:55:33 -0400 <tedcruz> Schiff, it has been alleged, spoke directly with the so-called "whistle-blower" and may even have helped him draft the complaint that launched this entire impeachment.
1219664842178662400 2020-01-21 11:55:33 -0400 <tedcruz> Under the standard put forth by the House Democrats today – that any potential fact witness cannot serve as counsel in the impeachment hearing – there is an obvious person who should be disqualified: Adam Schiff.
1219664841054543873 2020-01-21 11:55:33 -0400 <tedcruz> The Sixth Amendment provides the accused the right "to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense." Note that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the prosecution; it protects only the accused.
1219664839456559115 2020-01-21 11:55:32 -0400 <tedcruz> Democrats’ opening salvo in impeachment: they demand @realDonaldTrump  get rid of his lawyer, Pat Cipollone.  Absurd request.  Unlike the House, the Senate will have a FAIR trial. That means we won’t deny the President his lawyer ON THE DAY the trial starts.
1219651259399012352 2020-01-21 11:01:34 -0400 <tedcruz> I agree with @SenSchumer...
1219606809020899328 2020-01-21 08:04:57 -0400 <tedcruz> True.
1219605797631643649 2020-01-21 08:00:55 -0400 <tedcruz> Not the first in history to want to seize all the power (for the people, of course).  Usually works out well....
1219424111992197125 2020-01-20 19:58:58 -0400 <tedcruz> Inconceivable.
1219383515432783872 2020-01-20 17:17:39 -0400 <tedcruz> Prayers for Chandler Parsons for healing &amp; a swift recovery following this terrible accident. Spent many games cheering him on when has played for the @HoustonRockets Hope he’s able to fully recover.
1219359877186969613 2020-01-20 15:43:43 -0400 <tedcruz> Wow. WATCH this. Stunning.  Wonder why the media changed their mind?
1219337601087418369 2020-01-20 14:15:12 -0400 <tedcruz> Powerful. Very much worth watching. Last Sunday, I was blessed to worship with the congregation at West Freeway Church of Christ. I spent time with Jack Wilson and his family. Jack’s heroism saved many, many lives in the face of evil. This is his story.
1219335410989572096 2020-01-20 14:06:30 -0400 <tedcruz> Even for NBC, this is...odd.
1219289455707795456 2020-01-20 11:03:54 -0400 <tedcruz> Mr. King, you’re a talented writer.  May blessings abound for you and your family.  May love overflow in your life. I Peter 3:9
1218674755198472193 2020-01-18 18:21:18 -0400 <tedcruz> Who in their right mind would support releasing violent criminal illegal aliens into the community?  Regardless of your politics, why would that make sense?

1218572057358872577 2020-01-18 11:33:13 -0400 <tedcruz> Powerful. And important.
1218571934071390208 2020-01-18 11:32:43 -0400 <tedcruz> Thank you for defending our Liberty.
1218403495734403072 2020-01-18 00:23:24 -0400 <tedcruz> Strong.

1218267842992312322 2020-01-17 15:24:22 -0400 <tedcruz> .@realDonaldTrump allows @LSUfootball team behind the Resolute desk, same day as this announcement. Coincidence?
1218146107206795264 2020-01-17 07:20:38 -0400 <tedcruz> Pro tip: real “journalists” don’t (1) kiss up to every Dem, (2) refuse to ask them hard Qs, (3) relentlessly attack every Republican, (4) lie when doing so &amp; (5) always, always push the prevailing Dem narrative of the moment. You know this, as does Manu. You just choose not to.
1218144441703243776 2020-01-17 07:14:01 -0400 <tedcruz> NY Dem royalty Chris Cuomo declares “I can’t believe people would vote for” McSally, or McConnell, or any GOP candidate. Clutching his pearls, in the very same breath, he says he can’t understand why anyone might think CNN are liberal hacks.... 🤔
1218140898837630976 2020-01-17 06:59:56 -0400 <tedcruz> Let’s raise a glass and toast one of the least successful government regulatory schemes ever enacted. Turns out, Liberty works; statism, not so much.
1218051917638750209 2020-01-17 01:06:22 -0400 <tedcruz> If they’ve got $45m laying around, why exactly do they need taxpayer dollars?
1218050928600932354 2020-01-17 01:02:26 -0400 <tedcruz> “years-old”?
1217918878065537038 2020-01-16 16:17:43 -0400 <tedcruz> Seth, why is your party’s pres stage all-white? Only 78-yr-old socialists need apply? The GOP debate stage was quite different. Why has no Hispanic won even a single primary state in the history of Dem party? (In 2016, Marco won 1 &amp; I won 12–a fact MSM ignores.) #Opportunity4All

1217634848426397696 2020-01-15 21:29:05 -0400 <tedcruz> Given the circus in the House, I’m surprised she didn’t use crayons.  🎪 🖍 🎪
1217622209507876864 2020-01-15 20:38:51 -0400 <tedcruz> No.
1217153721253101568 2020-01-14 13:37:15 -0400 <tedcruz> As a Cuban-American, I’m offended.
1217151342071963649 2020-01-14 13:27:48 -0400 <tedcruz> Which clause of the Constitution gives a President the authority to give away a trillion $ w/o Congress?  And if you like this policy, how would you feel if/when a GOP president does it for something you don’t like?  Here’s a better idea: follow the Const &amp; don’t be a dictator.
1216241166770954240 2020-01-12 01:11:05 -0400 <tedcruz> some people did something.
1216240772497932288 2020-01-12 01:09:31 -0400 <tedcruz> I was in the classified briefing too. Credible intel that Soleimani was actively planning multiple deadly attacks against US serviceman &amp; civilians in the Middle East in a matter of days...that’s pretty damn imminent. If you didn’t hate Trump so much, this would be easy to admit.
1216238390275977216 2020-01-12 01:00:03 -0400 <tedcruz> These two statements are not mutually compatible.
1216237209885577216 2020-01-12 00:55:22 -0400 <tedcruz> If they had their way, without any govt, you could take a swing at them.  Over Chinese food.
1216236793957376000 2020-01-12 00:53:42 -0400 <tedcruz> Just when you were feeling “I’ve accomplished a lot in life....”
1216233094648336385 2020-01-12 00:39:00 -0400 <tedcruz> Damn....
1216230721066500097 2020-01-12 00:29:35 -0400 <tedcruz> True.
1216202073341145088 2020-01-11 22:35:44 -0400 <tedcruz> Exactly right.
1216114744425418755 2020-01-11 16:48:44 -0400 <tedcruz> Of course. All 70-year-old white socialists are welcome.
1216114469060911104 2020-01-11 16:47:38 -0400 <tedcruz> A fair Q.
1216035057963622401 2020-01-11 11:32:05 -0400 <tedcruz> There may be some injuries at the Dem Convention.
1215788629336915973 2020-01-10 19:12:52 -0400 <tedcruz> Maybe this broke the logjam!
1215713094707695617 2020-01-10 14:12:43 -0400 <tedcruz> Text I just got: “Hi X, I'm Y, a MoveOn volunteer. President Trump has been impeached.... Now we need to do everything we can to ensure both he &amp; complicit Republicans are defeated. Will you commit to voting Democratic in November?” Um, remember why y’all were formed? ...MOVE ON!
1215373204493160449 2020-01-09 15:42:07 -0400 <tedcruz> Uh, Pete, they weren’t “caught in the middle.”  They were shot down BY IRAN. Military incompetence by the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Just because Dems hate Trump doesn’t justify false equivalence w/ Iran. Soleimani was a brutal terrorist who killed hundreds of Americans.
1215297446697410562 2020-01-09 10:41:05 -0400 <tedcruz> Did somebody get sent to the Principal’s office?
1214927950338019329 2020-01-08 10:12:50 -0400 <tedcruz> Pelosi strategy on impeachment.  https://t.co/KjqHFlOnNU
1214233494697730048 2020-01-06 12:13:19 -0400 <tedcruz> If you haven’t seen it yet, you should. Unforgettable. 🔥🔥🔥
1214072657479639040 2020-01-06 01:34:12 -0400 <tedcruz> Important call for bipartisanship from Joe Lieberman. Sadly, much of the hysteria from 2020 Dems stems from anti-Trump hatred. Nobody wants a land war in Iran—it’s not going to happen—but killing terrorists who are trying to kill Americans makes us safer.  https://t.co/t4CcjbTNr8
1213566291153432581 2020-01-04 16:02:05 -0400 <tedcruz> Terry Gilliam resists PC orthodoxy; Twitter outrage ensues: “I say let's kill him.”...”Let's have tea first.”...”Oh, stop your whining. First we kill him, then we have biscuts and tea.”
1213566180927115264 2020-01-04 16:01:39 -0400 <tedcruz> Woke reporter hates Monty Python.
1213538576652275713 2020-01-04 14:11:57 -0400 <tedcruz> Worth reading—Gen. David Petraeus interview on Soleimani: “Again, it is impossible to overstate the significance of this action. This is much more substantial than the killing of Osama bin Laden. It’s even more substantial than the killing of Baghdadi.”  https://t.co/scdAkYuuIF
1213151759809552384 2020-01-03 12:34:53 -0400 <tedcruz> Query to the good people of Iran:  if a so-called “Supreme” Leader no longer has alongside him his Quds force enforcer to ensure that the military will brutally suppress the people, is he still “supreme”?
1212978048531873792 2020-01-03 01:04:37 -0400 <tedcruz> Reading the headline—with apologies to Alan Jackson—AP should know the difference between Iraq and Iran.  https://t.co/IzLztbKIDk
1212960182583599104 2020-01-02 23:53:37 -0400 <tedcruz> Perhaps it would have been a better idea to send him $1.7 billion in unmarked bills, in pallets on planes in the dead of night, so he could kill more Americans?
1212958723074867201 2020-01-02 23:47:49 -0400 <tedcruz> According the the Obama Department of Defense, Qasem Soleimani was a terrorist directly responsible for the murder of over 500 US service men &amp; women. Why are congressional Dems outraged that he’s finally dead?  See more:   https://t.co/7MrD4tyM5y
1212855415949672449 2020-01-02 16:57:19 -0400 <tedcruz> “For Latinos, [Castro] was living proof that a Hispanic deserved positive national attention. And unlike..Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Castro was...Mexican American, and very proud of his humble origins.”  To CNN’s shock, Marco &amp; I are very both proud of our family origins.
1212854583233589249 2020-01-02 16:54:01 -0400 <tedcruz> In the history of the U.S., no Hispanic has ever won even a single Democratic presidential primary or caucus. (Fact the media will ignore: emphatically not true on the Republican side.) As this year’s field illustrates, Dem party is dominated by white, socialist septuagenarians.
1212842011851669504 2020-01-02 16:04:03 -0400 <tedcruz> The pattern of gross misconduct and abuse of power by senior leadership at the Obama DOJ &amp; FBI — documented in detail be the non-partisan Inspector General — is chilling, wrong, and dangerous.  And the MSM couldn’t care less....
1212839014128115719 2020-01-02 15:52:09 -0400 <tedcruz> If true, this is indefensible. Antisemitism is wrong, a pernicious evil, and we should be united against it.
1212838343421108232 2020-01-02 15:49:29 -0400 <tedcruz> I will vigorously defend your right not to believe — the First Amendment protects everyone’s rights of conscience — but heartily disagree whenever you choose to ridicule people of faith.
1212836421368733696 2020-01-02 15:41:50 -0400 <tedcruz> Pray that I do.
1212835204194287617 2020-01-02 15:37:00 -0400 <tedcruz> .@chucktodd speaking for the atheist heartland of America. And mocking religious believers. Any wonder why people distrust the media?
1212825014266990593 2020-01-02 14:56:31 -0400 <tedcruz> Yes. Or perhaps simply...  https://t.co/CQTcQAPoQD
1212419867254636544 2020-01-01 12:06:36 -0400 <tedcruz> What’s wrong with you? Is partisan hatred really that deep? We root for American soldiers, not against them.
