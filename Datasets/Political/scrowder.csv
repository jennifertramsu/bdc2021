1395115123568779270 2021-05-19 16:32:20 -0400 <scrowder> How about this. Dems get a full “January 6th Commission” when America gets a “Black Lives Matter Billion Dollar Riots Commission.”  If it’s not politics, I’d take that deal TOMORROW.  Fair?
1395098604344430596 2021-05-19 15:26:41 -0400 <scrowder> This week, Biden already threatened to run over a reporter with his car, called the Coast Guard a “dull class” and quoted Mao verbatim... and it’s not even Thursday.  And these are his MOST endearing qualities.

1386787041447456769 2021-04-26 16:59:30 -0400 <scrowder> Told you. Go woke, go broke.  https://t.co/wGuQnlAITI  https://t.co/onjSVmNoPm
1386348949435342849 2021-04-25 11:58:41 -0400 <scrowder> For the first time in over half a decade, we won’t be live-streaming the #Oscars.  Why? It’s a non-show broadcast from a train station featuring films no one has seen or cared about.  Expect a HUUUUUGE drop in viewership this year.
1385595241277759490 2021-04-23 10:03:43 -0400 <scrowder> Wait... I pay corporate, payroll, property, income and sales taxes... then if I choose to invest what remains in American businesses and the economy, I’ll be taxed on it again (amidst the rampant effective tax that is inflation)... I now work for the Government.
1385377902108237829 2021-04-22 19:40:05 -0400 <scrowder> Much better to endanger an innocent civilian via stray bullet than to aim it squarely at the attempted murderess.
1385358496166785029 2021-04-22 18:22:58 -0400 <scrowder> Hahahaha. This is a rare instance, where it is quantifiably perceptible, in REAL time, that Juan Williams realizes the words coming out of his mouth are stupid.
1385345211962953730 2021-04-22 17:30:11 -0400 <scrowder> #UFC261's @GamebredFighter shares how Jake Paul would match up against a real fighter. HINT: Paul might need to eat through a straw...  https://t.co/EIgcNSgs7G
1385343902723428352 2021-04-22 17:24:59 -0400 <scrowder> Today, I got an exclusive with Jorge Masvidal. He said “Kamaru Usman hits like a bitch” #UFC261 WATCH:  https://t.co/vYSdfpV8nD
1385257253805101063 2021-04-22 11:40:40 -0400 <scrowder> We can't find common ground based on a lie. #FatPride is based on a lie.  https://t.co/Ni0HQvh1n0
1385236581133561858 2021-04-22 10:18:32 -0400 <scrowder> How much longer before media dies out due to their own illegitimacy?
1385228243955949571 2021-04-22 09:45:24 -0400 <scrowder> We have a VERY special guest today, "Eric Nelson"!
1385201719055953924 2021-04-22 08:00:00 -0400 <scrowder> People are saying #UFC261 could be the biggest PPV ever. Guess whose show @GamebredFighter will be on this morning?  https://t.co/1Wmbcs6T3P
1385165941323943942 2021-04-22 05:37:50 -0400 <scrowder> When I have @GamebredFighter on the show, I wake up pumped. Anything can happen.
1384981602145427463 2021-04-21 17:25:20 -0400 <scrowder> Sounds like you’ve made some bad decisions!
1384972416896618500 2021-04-21 16:48:50 -0400 <scrowder> And for saving a black girl’s life.
1384938108412735495 2021-04-21 14:32:30 -0400 <scrowder> Ummm obese people are healthy and beautiful too.  #FatPhobic
1384929939401547786 2021-04-21 14:00:02 -0400 <scrowder> I heard Greg Gutfeld's comments in their full context. What he said is true. And THAT is part of the problem.  https://t.co/r8Nep1oY4v
1384904415979708416 2021-04-21 12:18:37 -0400 <scrowder> Police made a MISTAKE releasing the #makhiabryant footage. You should NEVER give in to the mob.  https://t.co/GxVhROx1w1
1384879821025685525 2021-04-21 10:40:53 -0400 <scrowder> Nancy Pelosi managed to even piss off the left. And, actually, they have a point...  https://t.co/KhyGMd2LoU

1384870641459810310 2021-04-21 10:04:25 -0400 <scrowder> Running late, getting some new info about the Columbus shooting. See you at 10:15!
1384847869572755460 2021-04-21 08:33:55 -0400 <scrowder> #MakhiaBryant situation is proof positive that facts don’t matter to the mob. She was MID-FUCKING-STAB when she was rightfully shot by police. This morning’s show will NOT be for the faint of heart. 10AM ET. #Lwac
1384667932634976261 2021-04-20 20:38:55 -0400 <scrowder> A LOT to say about Chauvin/George Floyd verdict. Combing through the info, and will go through it all tomorrow. 10AM ET. #LwC
1384646309366296582 2021-04-20 19:13:00 -0400 <scrowder> Context matters. Sorry if that spoils your quest to find racism in every facet of everything. Full #ChangeMyMind episode =&gt;  https://t.co/6cYufRQXhP  https://t.co/REi9Eyc2od
1384639638803869703 2021-04-20 18:46:29 -0400 <scrowder> Appeasing the mob is futile.
1384624186623021061 2021-04-20 17:45:05 -0400 <scrowder> See. It was never about #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd. To everyone out there, stay safe.  https://t.co/sBP3Ogv3C4
1384623714331873280 2021-04-20 17:43:13 -0400 <scrowder> ... aaaand the message received.
1384617219817046017 2021-04-20 17:17:24 -0400 <scrowder> Of course there was going to be a pivot. Expect more police to quit in the coming weeks.
1384585659491487747 2021-04-20 15:12:00 -0400 <scrowder> Wait... does requiring a voter ID actually INCREASE voter turnout? Full episode of #ChangeMyMind =&gt;  https://t.co/Lx1afV6vwv  https://t.co/iWvDPryeU5
1384561654348779523 2021-04-20 13:36:36 -0400 <scrowder> The first tweet sharing this video was incorrectly titled. @Courtneyscoffs has since fired herself.  https://t.co/dPXQYdhLzg

1384292089635098624 2021-04-19 19:45:27 -0400 <scrowder> Maxine Waters’ REPEATED calls to harass, bully and “mob” dissenters is a direct threat to all free citizens of this country.
1384243749618814989 2021-04-19 16:33:22 -0400 <scrowder> Drug use is irrelevant in a drug overdose?
1384235356112015360 2021-04-19 16:00:01 -0400 <scrowder> WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT BRIAN STELTER CARRYNG A PURSE???  https://t.co/ct7ZciUO2Y
1384211973206810625 2021-04-19 14:27:06 -0400 <scrowder> THIS is what you need to be ready for. They are trying to INTIMIDATE the jury. #DerekChauvinTrial  https://t.co/juLaM9neO1
1384207476527026180 2021-04-19 14:09:14 -0400 <scrowder> In an LwC EXCLUSIVE, @BenAsken explains what went wrong in the Jake Paul fight.  https://t.co/uXHAEYLZIi
1384077315173273601 2021-04-19 05:32:01 -0400 <scrowder> Covering the Chauvin trial closing statements today AND joined by @Benaskren. An eclectic mix, but a barn burner. 10AM ET! #LwC
1383795700144558087 2021-04-18 10:52:59 -0400 <scrowder> If Trump was removed from Twitter AND Facebook for “inciting violence” then Maxine Waters needs to be federally charged and impeached.
1383613714834755589 2021-04-17 22:49:50 -0400 <scrowder> This is legitimately the worst thing I have ever watched. #TrillerFightClub
1383609863465365504 2021-04-17 22:34:32 -0400 <scrowder> My wife just asked me why I was watching “strippers on TV.” #TrillerFightClub has set humankind back.
1383607938086969346 2021-04-17 22:26:53 -0400 <scrowder> Hahahahahaha.
1383439790075387914 2021-04-17 11:18:43 -0400 <scrowder> Do you really want to talk with someone who’s been on the frontlines against CoVid misinformation or do you still have the same guest “screener?”
1383191280755281922 2021-04-16 18:51:14 -0400 <scrowder> Some pointers I learned on how to transition my skill set into some semblance of punching power. Just like my buddy @benaskren. #PaulAskren #TrillerFightClub   You know, without the experience, achievements or talent...  https://t.co/Qal9WlYvxs

1383105981077286914 2021-04-16 13:12:17 -0400 <scrowder> Crowder shop is back ONLINE! Shopify kicked us off without giving a reason. We had to pivot to another e-commerce platform. Our store is back though. You KNOW WHAT TO DO!  https://t.co/8o6vPfGlt6
1383048438187663363 2021-04-16 09:23:38 -0400 <scrowder> You lie. Lil’ Homicide was shooting at cars and was holding said gun up until 0.8 seconds before he was shot.
1383040063852802053 2021-04-16 08:50:21 -0400 <scrowder> What happened in Indianapolis is absolutely heart-breaking. Whether you’re Conservative or a Leftist. We all have empathy, but different solutions.  One is right and one is wrong.  Prayers for all the families affected.
1382851818149974018 2021-04-15 20:22:20 -0400 <scrowder> Today, sitting members of Congress demanded that @TuckerCarlson, a member of the press, be censored.  https://t.co/b6RSCwiWhd  ... still think you’re free?
1382820771857240065 2021-04-15 18:18:58 -0400 <scrowder> The Crowder Shop site has been taken down. Again. Our merch team is working on an alternative and you'll be updated when we're updated.   Irritated? Yes. Defeated? No.  https://t.co/XcufkUBCNt
1382801289902387201 2021-04-15 17:01:33 -0400 <scrowder> ... ‘member when liberals used to vilify “Big Pharma?”
1382797837369430023 2021-04-15 16:47:50 -0400 <scrowder> Twitter just suspended James O'Keefe, for acting well within the bounds of the law in exposing media bias and corruption.  Anyone who denies the danger of this control on information in the public square is a fascist and not your friend.  https://t.co/zbzOSGwMla
1382794069563297794 2021-04-15 16:32:51 -0400 <scrowder> If you’re in Virginia Beach and you miss this, you’re a fool.
1382740753340891143 2021-04-15 13:01:00 -0400 <scrowder> Ben &amp; Jerry's, ice cream makers from Vermont, have told us all what "the problem" is: white supremacy. The hot takes are almost unbearable.  https://t.co/DUkjea3ANF
1382728170114277376 2021-04-15 12:11:00 -0400 <scrowder> Packing the Supreme Court will fundamentally change our government. If you're okay with that now, are you okay with that when the OTHER SIDE is in power?  https://t.co/gjW45RP2gF
1382720856560857088 2021-04-15 11:41:56 -0400 <scrowder> Geraldo went a little crazy on @dbongino. Have you see this?  https://t.co/J6iEOJj06D
1382714329129046016 2021-04-15 11:16:00 -0400 <scrowder> The fundamental reason for sports is to be the best. Men competing against women undermines this.
1382707910590013445 2021-04-15 10:50:30 -0400 <scrowder> Are you okay with it the NEXT TIME a Trump-like president is in power?!
1382707635237969920 2021-04-15 10:49:24 -0400 <scrowder> Here's the issue with adding to the Supreme Court: if they add 4 judges, right now it's whatever Dems want. And then it just becomes an arms race. Dems add 4, Republicans add 3 more. Once you start this, you can't put the genie back in the bottle.
1382650993737822209 2021-04-15 07:04:19 -0400 <scrowder> Sometimes I wake up excited for a show. Today I get to tear down @Trevornoah’s AWFUL transgender-sports propaganda and host @WhitlockJason. It is one of those days...  10AM ET. #LwC
1382640115814690822 2021-04-15 06:21:06 -0400 <scrowder> Hey @LandauDave, you left your GoldBond powder in my guest room, do you need me to next-day ship it again?
1382378218980831234 2021-04-14 13:00:25 -0400 <scrowder> Imagine a trial where ONLY the prosecution could call witnesses. What we're seeing Big Tech do now, censoring any opposing viewpoint it doesn't like, is exactly that.  https://t.co/jCFanbMDZJ
1382343122760441856 2021-04-14 10:40:57 -0400 <scrowder> When we talk about "rape culture," are we only supposed to care about fake allegations?  https://t.co/NQUdEo0LYI
1382317371407298563 2021-04-14 08:58:38 -0400 <scrowder> Going to spend quite a bit of time on the real, overlooked victim today.  Jacob Blake’s sexually abused wife. Remember her? You will.  10AM ET. #LwC
1382088453987442688 2021-04-13 17:49:00 -0400 <scrowder> The most disturbing aspect of all of this is that only yesterday, claiming that the Johnson and Johnson vaccine may not be entirely safe was a violation of YouTube’s “community guidelines” and could have resulted in an immediate removal.  ... do you feel free?
1382019035483750405 2021-04-13 13:13:09 -0400 <scrowder> New Change my Mind is LIVE. You might actually be surprised how this one goes.  https://t.co/6QZ5D9sbaZ
1382014713668730884 2021-04-13 12:55:58 -0400 <scrowder> Johnson &amp; Johnson, a dead family company.
1381970750857433089 2021-04-13 10:01:17 -0400 <scrowder> Thanks for the heads up.
1381931629736833033 2021-04-13 07:25:50 -0400 <scrowder> COMMON GROUND? Okay, let’s raise the corporate tax rate exclusively on the Fortune 500 companies like Apple, Coke, Facebook, Amazon, Delta etc. the vast majority of them openly virtue signal and support it. Lower it for all mid-sized businesses or below. DNC, any takers?
1381705041749360644 2021-04-12 16:25:27 -0400 <scrowder> No, it’s because of the violent riots.
1381691308146843654 2021-04-12 15:30:53 -0400 <scrowder> A “routine traffic stop” doesn’t typically involve a violent felon with an active warrant, violently resisting arrest. You are the problem.
1381690586097410049 2021-04-12 15:28:00 -0400 <scrowder> Watched the full footage. Takeaways: 1) This has nothing to do with race.  2) The female cop yelling “taser!” before using an ACTUAL FIREARM should be fired for ineptitude.  3) If you have a violent rap sheet and an active warrant, please don’t violently resist arrest.
1381618291395817472 2021-04-12 10:40:44 -0400 <scrowder> Just don't burn other people's stuff. Yes?
1381616205119725575 2021-04-12 10:32:27 -0400 <scrowder> Common ground? Wait (don't) before you burn other people's stuff down.
1381555291452538880 2021-04-12 06:30:24 -0400 <scrowder> Slow-ish news day... So why not a thorough debunking of Biden’s executive actions on guns as to leave no doubt! Also 7+1 Uses for David Hogg’s now defunct “GoodPillow” company. Get your protest click-fingers ready! 10AM ET. #LwC
1381260101999341569 2021-04-11 10:57:25 -0400 <scrowder> ... what about trans people being able to keep and bear arms?
1380880926541025283 2021-04-10 09:50:43 -0400 <scrowder> Grew up on DMX, hid his albums from my parents, and used his songs as intros for early stand up shows. Now being accused of appropriation and I don’t care. #RIPDMX. One of the best to ever do it.  https://t.co/ocDer1RKzX
1380876966681837572 2021-04-10 09:34:58 -0400 <scrowder> #RIPDMX. Making woke white people uncomfortable since 1970.  https://t.co/bj5iOUK90W
1380609523459579910 2021-04-09 15:52:15 -0400 <scrowder> Common sense gun control is nonsense. #ChangeMyMind and yes, the sign is hand made. We're crafty.  https://t.co/KtuGWq3Sz0

1380562366346096642 2021-04-09 12:44:52 -0400 <scrowder> We're having to relocate for this morning's first Change my Mind. Will update with new location when we're relocated!
1380553087966793736 2021-04-09 12:08:00 -0400 <scrowder> Setting up a #ChangeMyMind right now! We’re on the corner of Daniel &amp; Durham in front of Greek housing at SMU!
1380506253378658307 2021-04-09 09:01:54 -0400 <scrowder> Filming several “Change my Minds” today. On  A) Opposing Voter I.D. Is Racist B) Biden’s Executive Actions on Guns are Bullshit #ChangeMyMind
1380239349988622337 2021-04-08 15:21:19 -0400 <scrowder> I support background checks. Good thing they already exist! Requiring an I.D. to vote is no more a violation of your rights than it is to purchase a firearm. Common ground? #ShallNotBeInfringed
1380194717573480454 2021-04-08 12:23:58 -0400 <scrowder> “Ghost guns” are not a thing and pistols are already more heavily regulated than rifles regardless of “a fitted brace.”  Everything Biden has said today is misleading or flat out wrong.
1380194458868850688 2021-04-08 12:22:56 -0400 <scrowder> Perfect! Will be conducting an impromptu #ChangeMyMind tomorrow on Biden’s unconstitutional executive gun actions. Details to follow.
1380136840087412737 2021-04-08 08:33:59 -0400 <scrowder> As I travel/prep for next week’s #ChangeMyMind, @LandauDave and @GmorganJr will be filling in for me today. Follow and berate them for me. 10AM ET!
1379896947906068488 2021-04-07 16:40:44 -0400 <scrowder> If you haven’t watched the Chauvin trial, today has been a REEEEALLY bad day for the prosecution. They must be livid.
1379779567209025541 2021-04-07 08:54:18 -0400 <scrowder> Today I am going to test the theory and have my producer (and @GmorganJr) kneel on my neck for 9 minutes, live on concrete. No tricks, no cuts. We need to walk a mile in another’s shoes... 10AM ET. #LwC
1379564805552492545 2021-04-06 18:40:55 -0400 <scrowder> If requiring I.D. is racist, then @Delta is racist as hell.
